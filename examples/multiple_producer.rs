// # Indexing from different threads.
//
// It is fairly common to have to index from different threads.
// Tantivy forbids to create more than one `IndexWriter` at a time.
//
// This `IndexWriter` itself has its own multithreaded layer, so managing your own
// indexing threads will not help. However, it can still be useful for some applications.
//
// For instance, if preparing documents to send to tantivy before indexing is the bottleneck of
// your application, it is reasonable to have multiple threads.
//
// Another very common reason to want to index from multiple threads, is implementing a webserver
// with CRUD capabilities. The server framework will most likely handle request from
// different threads.
//
// The recommended way to address both of these use case is to wrap your `IndexWriter` into a
// `Arc<RwLock<IndexWriter>>`.
//
// While this is counterintuitive, adding and deleting documents do not require mutability
// over the `IndexWriter`, so several threads will be able to do this operation concurrently.
//
// The example below does not represent an actual real-life use case (who would spawn thread to
// index a single document?), but aims at demonstrating the mechanism that makes indexing
// from several threads possible.
