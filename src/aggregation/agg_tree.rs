/// compute and return the number of documents that "fell into" each bucket.
/// Bucket aggregations, as opposed to metrics aggregations, can hold sub-aggregations. These sub-aggregations will be aggregated for the buckets created
/// by their "parent" bucket aggregation.
/// There are different bucket aggregators, each with a different "bucketing" strategy. Some define a single bucket, some define fixed number of multiple
/// buckets, and others dynamically create the buckets during the aggregation process.

/// metrics aggregation. The distinction between single-value and multi-value numeric metrics aggregations plays a role when these aggregations serve as
