/// The `Query` trait defines a set of documents and a scoring method
/// for those documents.
///
/// The `Query` trait is in charge of defining :
///
/// - a set of documents
/// - a way to score these documents
///
/// When performing a [search](#method.search),  these documents will then
/// be pushed to a [Collector](../collector/trait.Collector.html),
/// which will in turn be in charge of deciding what to do with them.
///
/// Concretely, this scored docset is represented by the
/// [`Scorer`](./trait.Scorer.html) trait.
///
/// Because our index is actually split into segments, the
/// query does not actually directly creates `DocSet` object.
/// Instead, the query creates a [`Weight`](./trait.Weight.html)
/// object for a given searcher.
///
/// The weight object, in turn, makes it possible to create
/// a scorer for a specific [`SegmentReader`](../struct.SegmentReader.html).
///
/// So to sum it up :
/// - a `Query` is recipe to define a set of documents as well the way to score them.
/// - a `Weight` is this recipe tied to a specific `Searcher`. It may for instance
/// hold statistics about the different term of the query. It is created by the query.
/// - a `Scorer` is a cursor over the set of matching documents, for a specific
/// [`SegmentReader`](../struct.SegmentReader.html). It is created by the
/// [`Weight`](./trait.Weight.html).
///
/// When implementing a new type of `Query`, it is normal to implement a
/// dedicated `Query`, `Weight` and `Scorer`.
