// whether the document was added before or after
// the delete operation. This anteriority is used by comparing
// the docstamp of the document.
//
// The doc to opstamp mapping stores precisely an array
// indexed by doc id and storing the opstamp of the document.
//
// This mapping is NOT necessarily increasing, because
// we might be sorting documents according to a fast field.
