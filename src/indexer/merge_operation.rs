/// - `target_opstamp` is the opstamp up to which we want to consume the
/// delete queue and reflect their deletes.
/// - `segment_ids` is the list of segment to be merged.
///
/// The second role is to ensure keep track of the fact that these
/// segments are in merge and avoid starting a merge operation that
/// may conflict with this one.
///
/// This works by tracking merge operations. When considering computing
/// merge candidates, we simply list tracked merge operations and remove
/// their segments from possible merge candidates.
