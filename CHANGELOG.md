*0.9.0 index format is not compatible with the 
previous index format.*
- Removed most unsafe (@fulmicoton)

  They are guaranteed to happen together (i.e. they cannot be split by a commit). 
  In addition, adds are guaranteed to happen on the same segment. (@elbow-jason)
- Removed `INT_STORED` and `INT_INDEXED`. It is now possible to use `STORED` and `INDEXED`
  for int fields. (@fulmicoton)
- Added DateTime field (@barrotsteindev)


Tantivy 0.8.2

Fixing build for x86_64 platforms. (#496)
No need to update from 0.8.1 if tantivy
is building on your platform.

Thanks to @KodrAus ! (#108)
- Various dependy version update (Thanks to @Ameobea) #76
- Fixed several race conditions in `Index.wait_merge_threads`
- Fixed #72. Mmap were never released.
