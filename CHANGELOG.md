Tantivy 0.13.0
======================
Tantivy 0.13 introduce a change in the index format that will require
you to reindex your index (BlockWAND information are added in the skiplist). 
The index size increase is minor as this information is only added for
full blocks.
If you have a massive index for which reindexing is not an option, please contact me
so that we can discuss possible solutions.

- Bugfix in `FuzzyTermQuery` not matching terms by prefix when it should (@Peachball)
- Relaxed constraints on the custom/tweak score functions. At the segment level, they can be mut, and they are not required to be Sync + Send.
- `MMapDirectory::open` does not return a `Result` anymore.
- Change in the DocSet and Scorer API. (@fulmicoton). 
A freshly created DocSet point directly to their first doc. A sentinel value called TERMINATED marks the end of a DocSet.
`.advance()` returns the new DocId. `Scorer::skip(target)` has been replaced by `Scorer::seek(target)` and returns the resulting DocId.
As a result, iterating through DocSet now looks as follows
```rust
let mut doc = docset.doc();
while doc != TERMINATED {
   // ...
   doc = docset.advance();
}
```
The change made it possible to greatly simplify a lot of the docset's code.
- Misc internal optimization and introduction of the `Scorer::for_each_pruning` function. (@fulmicoton)
- Added an offset option to the Top(.*)Collectors. (@robyoung)
- Added Block WAND. Performance on TOP-K on term-unions should be greatly increased. (@fulmicoton, and special thanks 
to the PISA team for answering all my questions!)

Tantivy 0.12.0
======================
- Removing static dispatch in tokenizers for simplicity. (#762)
- Added backward iteration for `TermDictionary` stream. (@halvorboe)
- Fixed a performance issue when searching for the posting lists of a missing term (@audunhalland)
- Added a configurable maximum number of docs (10M by default) for a segment to be considered for merge (@hntd187, landed by @halvorboe #713) 
- Important Bugfix #777, causing tantivy to retain memory mapping. (diagnosed by @poljar)
- Added support for field boosting. (#547, @fulmicoton)

## How to update?

Crates relying on custom tokenizer, or registering tokenizer in the manager will require some 
minor changes. Check https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy/blob/master/examples/custom_tokenizer.rs
to check for some code sample.

Tantivy 0.11.3
=======================
- Fixed DateTime as a fast field (#735)

Tantivy 0.11.2
=======================
- The future returned by `IndexWriter::merge` does not borrow `self` mutably anymore (#732)
- Exposing a constructor for `WatchHandle` (#731)

Tantivy 0.11.1
=====================
- Bug fix #729


Tantivy 0.11.0
=====================

- Added f64 field. Internally reuse u64 code the same way i64 does (@fdb-hiroshima)
- Various bugfixes in the query parser.
    - Better handling of hyphens in query parser. (#609)
    - Better handling of whitespaces.
- Closes #498 - add support for Elastic-style unbounded range queries for alphanumeric types eg. "title:>hello", "weight:>=70.5", "height:<200" (@petr-tik)
- API change around `Box<BoxableTokenizer>`. See detail in #629
- Avoid rebuilding Regex automaton whenever a regex query is reused. #639 (@brainlock)
- Add footer with some metadata to index files. #605 (@fdb-hiroshima)
- Add a method to check the compatibility of the footer in the index with the running version of tantivy (@petr-tik)
- TopDocs collector: ensure stable sorting on equal score. #671 (@brainlock)
- Added handling of pre-tokenized text fields (#642), which will enable users to
  load tokens created outside tantivy. See usage in examples/pre_tokenized_text. (@kkoziara)
- Fix crash when committing multiple times with deleted documents. #681 (@brainlock)

## How to update?

- The index format is changed. You are required to reindex your data to use tantivy 0.11. 
- `Box<dyn BoxableTokenizer>` has been replaced by a `BoxedTokenizer` struct.
- Regex are now compiled when the `RegexQuery` instance is built. As a result, it can now return
an error and handling the `Result` is required.
- `tantivy::version()` now returns a `Version` object. This object implements `ToString()`

Tantivy 0.10.2
=====================

- Closes #656. Solving memory leak.

Tantivy 0.10.1
=====================

- Closes #544.  A few users experienced problems with the directory watching system.
Avoid watching the mmap directory until someone effectively creates a reader that uses
this functionality.


Tantivy 0.10.0
=====================

*Tantivy 0.10.0 index format is compatible with the index format in 0.9.0.*

- Added an API to easily tweak or entirely replace the 
 default score. See `TopDocs::tweak_score`and `TopScore::custom_score` (@pmasurel)
- Added an ASCII folding filter (@drusellers)
- Bugfix in `query.count` in presence of deletes (@pmasurel)
- Added `.explain(...)` in `Query` and `Weight` to (@pmasurel)
- Added an efficient way to `delete_all_documents` in `IndexWriter` (@petr-tik). 
  All segments are simply removed.

Minor
---------
- Switched to Rust 2018 (@uvd)
- Small simplification of the code. 
Calling .freq() or .doc() when .advance() has never been called
on segment postings should panic from now on.
- Tokens exceeding `u16::max_value() - 4` chars are discarded silently instead of panicking.
- Fast fields are now preloaded when the `SegmentReader` is created.
- `IndexMeta` is now public.  (@hntd187)
- `IndexWriter` `add_document`, `delete_term`. `IndexWriter` is `Sync`, making it possible to use it with a `
Arc<RwLock<IndexWriter>>`. `add_document` and `delete_term` can 
only require a read lock. (@pmasurel)
- Introducing `Opstamp` as an expressive type alias for `u64`. (@petr-tik)
- Stamper now relies on `AtomicU64` on all platforms (@petr-tik)
- Bugfix - Files get deleted slightly earlier
- Compilation resources improved (@fdb-hiroshima)

## How to update?

Your program should be usable as is.

### Fast fields

Fast fields used to be accessed directly from the `SegmentReader`.
The API changed, you are now required to acquire your fast field reader via the
`segment_reader.fast_fields()`, and use one of the typed method: 
- `.u64()`, `.i64()` if your field is single-valued ;
- `.u64s()`, `.i64s()` if your field is multi-valued ;
- `.bytes()` if your field is bytes fast field.



Tantivy 0.9.0
=====================
*0.9.0 index format is not compatible with the 
previous index format.*
- MAJOR BUGFIX : 
  Some `Mmap` objects were being leaked, and would never get released. (@fulmicoton)
- Removed most unsafe (@fulmicoton)
- Indexer memory footprint improved. (VInt comp, inlining the first block. (@fulmicoton)
- Stemming in other language possible (@pentlander)
- Segments with no docs are deleted earlier (@barrotsteindev)
- Added grouped add and delete operations. 
  They are guaranteed to happen together (i.e. they cannot be split by a commit). 
  In addition, adds are guaranteed to happen on the same segment. (@elbow-jason)
- Removed `INT_STORED` and `INT_INDEXED`. It is now possible to use `STORED` and `INDEXED`
  for int fields. (@fulmicoton)
- Added DateTime field (@barrotsteindev)
- Added IndexReader. By default, index is reloaded automatically upon new commits (@fulmicoton)
- SIMD linear search within blocks (@fulmicoton)

## How to update ?

tantivy 0.9 brought some API breaking change.
To update from tantivy 0.8, you will need to go through the following steps.

- `schema::INT_INDEXED` and `schema::INT_STORED`  should be replaced by `schema::INDEXED` and `schema::INT_STORED`.
- The index now does not hold the pool of searcher anymore. You are required to create an intermediary object called 
`IndexReader` for this. 
    
    ```rust
    // create the reader. You typically need to create 1 reader for the entire
    // lifetime of you program.
    let reader = index.reader()?;
    
    // Acquire a searcher (previously `index.searcher()`) is now written:
    let searcher = reader.searcher();
    
    // With the default setting of the reader, you are not required to 
    // call `index.load_searchers()` anymore.
    //
    // The IndexReader will pick up that change automatically, regardless
    // of whether the update was done in a different process or not.
    // If this behavior is not wanted, you can create your reader with 
    // the `ReloadPolicy::Manual`, and manually decide when to reload the index
    // by calling `reader.reload()?`.
  
    ```
