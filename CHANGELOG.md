Tantivy 0.10.0
=====================

*Tantivy 0.10.0 index format is compatible with the index format in 0.9.0.*

- Added an API to easily tweak or entirely replace the 
 default score. See `TopDocs::tweak_score`and `TopScore::custom_score` (@pmasurel)
- Added an ASCII folding filter (@drusellers)
- Bugfix in `query.count` in presence of deletes (@pmasurel)
- Added `.explain(...)` in `Query` and `Weight` to (@pmasurel)
- Added an efficient way to `delete_all_documents` in `IndexWriter` (@petr-tik). 
  All segments are simply removed.

Minor
---------
- Switched to Rust 2018 (@uvd)
- Small simplification of the code. 
Calling .freq() or .doc() when .advance() has never been called
on segment postings should panic from now on.
- Tokens exceeding `u16::max_value() - 4` chars are discarded silently instead of panicking.
- Fast fields are now preloaded when the `SegmentReader` is created.
- `IndexMeta` is now public.  (@hntd187)
- `IndexWriter` `add_document`, `delete_term`. `IndexWriter` is `Sync`, making it possible to use it with a `
Arc<RwLock<IndexWriter>>`. `add_document` and `delete_term` can 
only require a read lock. (@pmasurel)
- Introducing `Opstamp` as an expressive type alias for `u64`. (@petr-tik)
- Stamper now relies on `AtomicU64` on all platforms (@petr-tik)
- Bugfix - Files get deleted slightly earlier
- Compilation resources improved (@fdb-hiroshima)

## How to update?

Your program should be usable as is.

### Fast fields

Fast fields used to be accessed directly from the `SegmentReader`.
The API changed, you are now required to acquire your fast field reader via the
`segment_reader.fast_fields()`, and use one of the typed method: 
- `.u64()`, `.i64()` if your field is single-valued ;
- `.u64s()`, `.i64s()` if your field is multi-valued ;
- `.bytes()` if your field is bytes fast field.



Tantivy 0.9.0
=====================
*0.9.0 index format is not compatible with the 
previous index format.*
- MAJOR BUGFIX : 
  Some `Mmap` objects were being leaked, and would never get released. (@fulmicoton)
- Removed most unsafe (@fulmicoton)
- Indexer memory footprint improved. (VInt comp, inlining the first block. (@fulmicoton)
- Stemming in other language possible (@pentlander)
- Segments with no docs are deleted earlier (@barrotsteindev)
- Added grouped add and delete operations. 
  They are guaranteed to happen together (i.e. they cannot be split by a commit). 
  In addition, adds are guaranteed to happen on the same segment. (@elbow-jason)
- Removed `INT_STORED` and `INT_INDEXED`. It is now possible to use `STORED` and `INDEXED`
  for int fields. (@fulmicoton)
- Added DateTime field (@barrotsteindev)
- Added IndexReader. By default, index is reloaded automatically upon new commits (@fulmicoton)
- SIMD linear search within blocks (@fulmicoton)

## How to update ?

tantivy 0.9 brought some API breaking change.
To update from tantivy 0.8, you will need to go through the following steps.

- `schema::INT_INDEXED` and `schema::INT_STORED`  should be replaced by `schema::INDEXED` and `schema::INT_STORED`.
- The index now does not hold the pool of searcher anymore. You are required to create an intermediary object called 
`IndexReader` for this. 
    
    ```rust
    // create the reader. You typically need to create 1 reader for the entire
    // lifetime of you program.
    let reader = index.reader()?;
    
    // Acquire a searcher (previously `index.searcher()`) is now written:
    let searcher = reader.searcher();
    
    // With the default setting of the reader, you are not required to 
    // call `index.load_searchers()` anymore.
    //
    // The IndexReader will pick up that change automatically, regardless
    // of whether the update was done in a different process or not.
    // If this behavior is not wanted, you can create your reader with 
    // the `ReloadPolicy::Manual`, and manually decide when to reload the index
    // by calling `reader.reload()?`.
  
    ```
