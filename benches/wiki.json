In a NoRMA architecture, the address space globally is not unique and the memory is not globally accessible by the processors. Accesses to remote memory modules are only indirectly possible by messages through the interconnection network to other processors, which in turn possibly deliver the desired data in a reply message. The entire storage configuration is partitioned statically among the processors.\nThe advantage of the NoRMA model is the ability to construct extremely large configurations, which is achieved by shifting the problem to the user configuration. Programs for NoRMA architectures need to evenly partitioning the data into local memory modules, ensure consistency of software caches to enforce the desired consistency model, handle transformations of data identifiers from one processor's address space to another, and realize a message-passing system for remote access to data. The programming model of Norma architecture is therefore extremely complicated.\n\n"}

Gallart is host of a Mega-TV television show named \"Descarao' Por La Noche\".\nBiography.\nRoque José Gallart Ortiz is the son of Roque José Gallart, Sr., himself a well-known radio announcer. Roque, Jr. would visit his dad's radio station and stay there until a school bus picked him up as a little kid. Roque, Jr. became interested in radio work during this era in his life.\nIn 1995, at age 16, he was hired by the radio station his dad worked for, 95X, in the Puerto Rican city of Bayamon. A few years later, he began to attend Universidad del Sagrado Corazon in Rio Piedras to study communications, but, feeling he was more advanced in his understanding of the radio world than his fellow students, he soon left the university and concentrated on his radio job.\nActing.\nRocky the Kid became a well known radio host in Puerto Rico over the years, and his fame allowed him to branch out into other areas of the show business world, starting in 2010, when he participated in \"\", playing himself along fellow radio personalities, actors and friends \"Tony Banana\" and Billy Fourquet. He then re-joined Fourquet in a 2011 comedy film named \"Que Joyitas!\", where he again played a version of himself.\nIn 2013, Gallart again played himself in \"Que Joyitas! II\", in which he was featured in the movie's poster. The three movies that Gallart has been in have been released in local cinemas in Puerto Rico, and Que Joyitas! has been shown in the United States television on Cine Latino.\nLo se Todo.\nFollowing a severe boycott by sponsors of Kobbo Santarrosa's gossip show, SuperXclusivo, WAPA America took that show off the air, and then hired six people, including Pedro Juan Figueroa, Sylvia Hernandez, \"Topy Mamery\" and Gallart, to host a new television show named \"Lo Se Todo\" in 2013. \"Lo Se Todo\" became a successful and highly rated show in Puerto Rican television, but internal turmoil plagued the show almost from the beginning. During 2014, Gallart once played a Black character in the show, with monkey sounds played in the background. As a consequence, the network received several calls from complaining viewers, which led to Gallart issuing a public apology in which he stated his intention was never to offend anyone based on race, religion, birth place or sexual preference, and a network producer to be fired.\nEarly in 2015, Gallart decided to leave \"Lo Se Todo\" after his radio employer, SBS, told him he would not be allowed to work with them and at WAPA-America consecutively. Offered a contract by WAPA-America on December 6, 2014, Gallart did not sign it, deciding instead to keep working on radio. The contract offer by WAPA-America came only 4 days after Mamery, who had also left \"Lo Se Todo\" and whom Gallart had befriended, died of a heart attack. Following the news of his friend's death, Gallart cried on live television.\nIn April 2015, Gallart declared on his radio show that \"Lo se Todo\" television personnel were victims of workplace harassment by show producer Niria Ruiz, also mentioning Joe Ramos in his comment, calling Pedro Juan Figueroa a hypocrite and traitor who never took the other hosts side against \"Lo Se Todo\" producers during arguments, affirming that Frankie Jay, another of the show's hosts, did so, and describing working conditions at \"Lo Se Todo\" as a \"living hell\".\nAs a consequence of those statements, on August 31, 2015, WAPA-America sued Gallart for the amount of $2,000,000 dollars, accusing him of defamation.\nMove to Mega-TV.\nOn March 9, 2015, Gallart began a new television show on Mega-TV, a Hispanic channel in the United States. The show, named \"Descarao' Por La Noche\" is seen in Puerto Rico and various cities in the United States, including Phoenix, New York City, LA and San Francisco, Houston, Miami and Chicago, among others.\nPersonal.\nGallart is married to \"Lo Se Todo\" host Jessica Serrano. Their first daughter, Emma Catalina Gallart Serrano, was born on November 14, 2015. He also has a son, Ricky, from an earlier relationship, and a step-daughter, Carolina.\nGallart was arrested and briefly jailed in November 2013 by Puerto Rican police after allegedly sending threatening messages to a former girlfriend. He was released almost immediately when a judge found no cause against him.\n\n"}

The town is situated on the south bank of the Yangtze river between Nanjing and Changzhou. It is thus at the intersection of China's Mandarin and Wu speaking regions. About 2.7 million Chinese live in the area where the Zhenjiang dialect is predominant.\nIn ancient times, Zhenjiang spoke Wu. Today, Wu is the language of nearby Changzhou, as well as Shanghai and Zhejiang Province. Mandarin speakers from the North have been immigrating to Zhenjiang since the fourth century, gradually changing the character of the local dialect. In modern times, the city speaks a dialect that is transitional between the Eastern Mandarin of Nanjing, located just west of the city, and the Taihu dialect of Wu spoken in Changzhou, which is just east of the city. Zhenjiang dialect is comprehensible to Nanjing residents, but not to Changzhou residents.\nThe issue of tones in the Zhenjiang dialect has been a topic scholarly study. Nanjing residents use the four tones of Mandarin, while Changzhou residents use seven or eight tones. According to a study by Qiu Chunan, Zhenjiang dialect has five citation tones: Tone1 (42) (a sharp fall from pitch 4 to pitch 2, or \"yinping\"), Tone2 (35) (a rising tone or \"yangping\"), Tone3 (32) (slight falling tone or \"shang\"), Tone4 (55) (high even or \"qu\"), and Tone5 (5) (checked tone or \"ru\"). Qiu's study used residents who had grown up in the Daxi Road area, where the standard form of the dialect is said to be spoken. The checked tone was a feature of Chinese spoken in the Middle Ages, but it is not part of Mandarin. Applying the theory of government phonology to the issue, Bao Zhiming noted that non-even tones become even when they appear before the high even, or 55, tone.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48688319","title":"Varian's theorems","body":"\nVarian's theorems\n\nIn welfare economics, Varian's theorems are several theorems related to fair allocation of homogeneous divisible resources. They describe conditions under which there exists a Pareto efficient (PE) envy-free (EF) allocation. They were published by Hal Varian in the 1970s.\nExamples.\nAll examples involve an economy with two goods, x and y, and two agents, Alice and Bob.\nA. Many PEEF allocations: Alice and Bob have linear utilities, representing substitute goods:\nThe total endowment is (4,4). If Alice receives at least 3 units of x, then her utility is 6 and she does not envy Bob. Similarly, if Bob receives at least 3 units of y, he does not envy Alice. So the allocation [(3,0);(1,4)] is PEEF with utilities (6,9). Similarly, the allocations [(4,0);(0,4)] and [(4,0.5);(0,3.5)] are PEEF. On the other hand, the allocation [(0,0);(4,4)] is PE but not EF (Alice envies Bob); the allocation [(2,2);(2,2)] is EF but not PE (the utilities are (6,6) but they can be improved e.g. to (8,8)).\nB. Essentially-single PEEF allocation: Alice and Bob have Leontief utilities, representing complementary goods:\nThe total endowment is (4,2). The equal allocation [(2,1);(2,1)] is PEEF with utility vector (1,1). EF is obvious (every equal allocation is EF). Regarding PE, note that both agents now want only y, so the only way to increase the utility of an agent is to take some y from the other agent, but this decreases the utility of the other agent. While there are other PEEF allocations, e.g. [(1.5,1);(2.5,1)], all have the same utility vector of (1,1), since it is not possible to give both agents more than 1. \nC. No PEEF allocations: Alice and Bob have concave utilities:\nThe total endowment is (4,2). The equal allocation [(2,1);(2,1)] is EF with utility vector (2,2). Moreover, \"every\" EF allocation must give both agents equal utility (since they have the same utility function) and this utility can be at most 2. However, no such allocation is PE, since it is Pareto-dominated by the allocation [(4,0);(0,2)] whose utility vector is (4,2).\nExistence of PEEF allocations with monotone convex preferences.\nVarian's theorem says that:\nIn the #Examples, the preferences are always monotone. However, only in examples A and B the preferences are convex.\nThe proof relies on the existence of a competitive equilibrium with equal incomes. Assume that all resources in an economy are divided equally between the agents. I.e, if the total endowment of the economy is formula_5, then each agent formula_6 receives an initial endowment formula_7.\nSince the preferences are \"convex\", the Arrow–Debreu model implies that a competitive equilibrium exists. I.e, there is a price vector formula_8 and a partition formula_9 such that:\nSuch an allocation is always EF. Proof: by the (EI) condition, for every formula_13. Hence, by the (CE) condition, formula_14.\nSince the preferences are \"monotonic\", any such allocation is also PE, since monotonicity implies local nonsatiation.

Last was an outstanding lecturer in postgraduate anatomy, and belonged to a small set of anatomists who were initially practising surgeons and then made a career teaching it. \nHenry Last, his grandfather, was from Debenham in Suffolk and jumped ship to settle in South Australia. His wife was Mary Ann Bowden who had Cornish roots. They later settled in Adelaide. \nHenry's eldest surviving son, John Last, worked at an Adelaide stationer and bookseller. John and his wife had 3 children, Raymond and two younger sisters, all being diligent and studious.\nRaymond first attended North Adelaide Primary School, from where he went on to the Adelaide Boys’ High School, where another scholar and classmate was Mark Oliphant, who went on to become an eminent physicist and later, Governor of South Australia. \nAssisted by a State Bursary, he enrolled at the University of Adelaide, and though underage, obtained permission to start the medical course. A brilliant trio headed the Medical School — John Burton Cleland in Pathology, Thorburn Brailsford Robertson in Physiology, and Frederic Wood Jones in Anatomy. Last was top student in all but the final year, and graduated MB BS in 1924.\nIn June 1939 Last and his second wife Margret, who had been Matron at Booleroo Centre District Hospital, set off for England in order to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. With the start of World War Two in September 1939 they began work at the Emergency Medical Service at the North London Fever Hospital at Winchmore Hill, later to become an annexe of the Royal London Hospital. Here Last worked under Henry Souttar.\nAs a member of the Australian Army Medical Corps Last was turned down by the British Army, so he was obliged to return to Australia to enlist there. \"MV Napier Star\" was torpedoed in the Irish Sea on 18 December 1940 (see List_of_shipwrecks_in_December_1940#18_December), only 28 of 99 people surviving, among which were Raymond and Margret Last. Raymond Last wrote an account of the event. They joined the British Red Cross Society and Last led a surgical team, his wife Margret being principal nurse, that formed part of the British forces sent to end the Italian occupation of Abyssinia. Last spent three years there, becoming personal physician to the Emperor Haile Selassie and his family. The closing year of the War saw Last heading a medical unit in Borneo, providing medical care for the civilian population.\nWhen Last returned to London and the Royal College of Surgeons, the Professor of Anatomy was Frederic Wood Jones, who had tutored Last in Adelaide, and inspired an enduring interest in comparative anatomy. After some years as anatomy demonstrator and curator, Last was appointed Professor of Applied Anatomy in 1950. His textbook, 'Anatomy Regional and Applied', was first published in 1954 and heralded a new generation of anatomy texts providing a more concise option to 'Gray's Anatomy' or Cunningham's 'Textbook of Anatomy'. It became known for its readability and interest, as it presented medical and surgical anatomy in a practical light, rather than as a colourless academic exercise. and rapidly gained popularity amongst surgical students. His own drawings were used as illustrations. Last became first Warden of the Nuffield College of Surgical Sciences, the residence for medical students. On his retiring a common room was named in his honour. \nFrom 1970-87 he held the chair of Visiting Professor in the Department of Anatomy at the University of California, Los Angeles. This appointment enabled his spending winter breaks in Adelaide, where he gave lectures and demonstrations in the dissecting room of the Adelaide Medical School, often making use of his superb chalk diagrams.\nThe Lasts chose Malta as a final place of retirement, partly because of its tax laws and partly because of his circle of friends, which included expatriate English people, local Maltese and a sprinkling of surgeons. Failing vision limited his drawing skills; and he suffered from senile gait syndrome, necessitating assistance when standing or walking. Margret died in January 1989, and Last stayed on in Malta. \nHe had two sons, John and Peter, by his first wife, both graduating in medicine from Adelaide University. He had no share in their upbringing. \n\n"}

Garnier, who had left Paris because of Paris Commune (1871), was looking for a land in Bordighera to build his future house. In 1871 he proposed the municipality to buy the land where only school of the city stayed. The offer of 6,000 pounds was very generous, it would have allowed the construction of a new school for which Garnier provided the plans.\nThe project included a classical building that integrates well with the old town of Bordighera that lies behind. The new schools foresaw not only a new section for boys replacing the previous one, but also a girls' section and one for small children. The project is to be considered truly innovative for its time and the municipality accepted the proposal. During the works, which were not followed by Garnier, there were numerous technical problems and delays in deliveries. It was only in 1878 that part of the building was finally terminated.\nMeanwhile, the population grew and the city decided to build a new school that was opened later in 1886. With the transfer of the school, the municipality decided to use the building as its headquarters. The facade was carved with the coat of arms of the city, a rampant lion that leans against a Pine seafarer. Inside the town hall you can admire numerous paintings from various artists who stayed in Bordighera, including: Pompeo Mariani, Giuseppe Ferdinando Piana, Giuseppe Balbo, Friederich von Kleudgen, etc.\nThe gardens.\nThe true gardens of the town hall are between the building designed by Charles Garnier and the Cape Esplanade. These gardens, although of small size, can boast two great Ficus macrophylla centenarians and many varieties of exotic plants (agaves, palm trees, cactus, etc.) which can also be seen in many Bordighera gardens. On 17 January 1954, the city placed a bust in honour of Ludwig Winter, its illustrious adopted citizen, as an honour to the man who had done so much to bring prestige to the city and to the Riviera. This is sometimes confusing. Some mistakenly call these gardens also \"Winter Gardens\", but the real Winter Garden are at 6 Ludovico Winter Street in Bordighera.\nAt the foot of the old town hall of Bordighera, there is a large wooden area that is called in various ways: the gardens of the Cape or, more commonly, Cape Pineta. The gardens are vast, and full of very old trees such as pines, olive trees, palm trees and a variety of other species, but very old specimens of Araucaria Heterophylla stand out. In the pine forest there is also a bust in honour of the painter Mosè Bianchi, who often came to Bordighera to spend time with his grandson Pompeo Mariani. Also in the Cape Pineta, but a bit lower, there is a monument in honour of Charles Garnier.\nOn May 15, 2015 the renovation of the Marabutto was terminated. It is an ancient powder keg that is currently in the Cape Pineta. The name is due to the shape of the small building that recalls the graves of Muslim holy men (a cube topped by a dome), whose name is precisely marabutto. Near the Marabutto, you can see three old cannons so much loved by the locals that they were given names: Butafoegu, Tiralogni et Cacastrasse.\nTrivia.\nWhen the city had to choose its coat of arms, a dispute broke out with the neighbouring city of Sanremo. Bordighera, which was nicknamed \"Queen of the Palms\", wanted to see represented the palm on his coat of arms, but the bigger rival city had already a similar one, so Bordighera had to settle for a pine.\nBehind the municipal building is one of four Ficus Magnolioides recognised by the State Forestry. The monumental tree has an estimated age of 100 years, with a height of 18 meters and a diameter of the stem of 1040 cm.\n\n"}

Most of them have higher education, occupying important positions in various sectors and making a great contribution to the economic, social and cultural development of Israel. \nThey have established several kibbutzim, moshavim and towns (Kiryat Bialik, Kiryat Tiv'on, Rosh Pinna, Zikhron Ya'akov). Between 1882 and 1884, Romanian Jews in Israel already established nine localities. \nImmigration history.\nMass emigration to Israel ensued (\"see Bricha and Aliyah\"). According to Sachar, for the first two post-war years, tens of thousands of Romanian Jews left for Israel; the Romanian government did not try to stop them, especially due to its desire to reduce its historically suspect and now impoverished Jewish minority. Afterwards, Jewish emigration began to encounter obstacles. In 1948, the year of Israeli independence, Zionism came under renewed suspicion, and the government began a campaign of liquidation against Zionist funds and training farms. However, emigration was not completely banned; Romanian Foreign Minister Ana Pauker, herself a Jew with a father and brother in Israel, negotiated an agreement with Israeli ambassador Reuven Rubin, a Romanian immigrant to Israel, under which the Romanian government would allow 4,000 Jews a month to emigrate to Israel; this decision was at least partially influenced by a large Jewish Agency bribe to the Romanian government. This agreement applied mainly to ruined businessmen and other economically \"redundant\" Jews. Around this time, Israel also secured another agreement with the Romanian government, under which Romania issued 100,000 exit visas for Jews and Israel supplied Romania with oil drills and pipes to aid the struggling Romanian oil industry. By December 1951, about 115,000 Romanian Jews had emigrated to Israel.\nThroughout the period of Communist rule, Romania allowed limited numbers of Jews to emigrate to Israel, in exchange for much-needed Israeli economic aid. By 1965, Israel was funding agricultural and industrial projects throughout Romania, and in exchange, Romania allowed limited numbers of Jews to emigrate to Israel. When Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power in 1965, he initially ended the trade in deference to the Eastern bloc's Arab allies. However, by 1969, he decided to exchange Jews for cash from Israel. Ceaușescu wanted economic independence from the Soviet Union, which was content to keep Romania a backwater and as nothing more than a supplier of raw materials, but to fund economic projects, he needed hard cash. As a result, from then until the Ceaușescu regime fell in 1989, about 1,500 Jews a year were granted exit visas to Israel in exchange for a payment of cash for every Jew allowed to leave, in addition to other Israeli aid. The exact payments were determined by the age, education, profession, employment, and family status of the emigrant. Israel paid a minimum of $2,000 per head for every emigrant, and paid prices in the range of $25,000 for doctors or scientists. In addition to these payments, Israel also secured loans for Romania and paid off the interest itself, and supplied the Romanian Army with military equipment.\nAs a result of aliyah, the Romanian-Jewish community was gradually depleted. By 1987, just 23,000 Jews were left in Romania, half of whom were over 65 years old.\nRelations with Romanian culture.\nRomanian Jews in Israel have strong relations with Romanian culture. Moreover, there is an intense activity among writers of Romanian language. In Israel exist 11 associations of writers in foreign languages, including the Association of Israeli Writers of Romanian Language (). Likewise, there are publications in Romanian languages, weekly, monthly or quarterly, plus several local issues.\nRomania has an embassy in Tel Aviv, three honorary consulates in Jerusalem, Beersheba and Haifa and a cultural institute in Tel Aviv.\nNotable people.\nThis is a list of Israeli people of Romanian Jewish descent:\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48688802","title":"Acoustocerebrography","body":"\nAcoustocerebrography\n\nAcoustocerebrography (ACG) refers to a diagnostic method in medicine that is used to diagnose pathological changes and illnesses in the brain and the central nervous system. \nIt can also be applied as a means to diagnose and monitor intracranial pressure, for example as incorporated into continuous brain monitoring device. As a method of transcranial, acoustic spectroscopy, ACG is based on Molecular Acoustics.\nIt allows for the non-invasive examination of the brain’s cell and molecular structure. ACG can use microphones, accelerometers or multi-frequency ultrasound (i.e. sound waves) to monitor changes. This methodology does not use any radiation and is completely free of any side effects. ACG also facilitates blood flow analysis as well as the detection of obstructions in cerebral blood flow.\nPassive and active Acoustocerebrography.\nPassive Acoustocerebrography.\nAll brain tissue is influenced by blood circulating in the brain’s vascular system. With each heartbeat, blood circulates in the skull, following a recurring pattern according to the oscillation produced. This oscillation’s effect, in turn, depends on the brain’s size, form, structure and its vascular system. Thus, every heartbeat stimulates minuscule motion in the brain tissue as well as cerebrospinal fluid and therefore produces minimal changes in intracranial pressure. These changes can be monitored and measured in the skull.\nToday, mostly passive sensors like accelerometers are used to identify these signals correctly. Sometimes highly sensitive microphones are utilized.\nWith a digital signal, it becomes possible to study the patterns of the blood flow moving inside the skull. These patterns form unique signatures that can be analyzed with specially designed algorithms, identifying them either as an inconspicuous, “normal” pattern or as a pattern showing an “abnormal” behavior.\nActive Acoustocerebrography.\nIn active ACG applications, a multi-frequency ultrasonic signal is used to detect and classify adverse changes at the cellular or molecular level.\nIn addition to all of the advantages that passive ACG provides, with active ACG it is possible to conduct a spectral analysis of the acoustic signals received. These spectrum analyses not only display changes in the brain’s vascular system, but also those in its cellular and molecular structures.\nOne common application of active ACG is the Transcranial Doppler test. More recently, its color version (TCCD) has been deployed. These ultrasonic procedures measure blood flow velocity within the brain’s blood vessels. They are used to diagnose embolisms, stenoses and vascular constrictions, for example, in the aftermath of a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\nFields of Application.\nContrary to applications that provide only momentary images, such as MRI and CT, the results of ACG procedures can be obtained continuously, thus facilitating effortless and non-invasive real-time monitoring. This can be especially helpful during the acute phase directly after a stroke or a traumatic brain injury. The measured data is mathematically processed continuously and displayed on a monitoring device. The computer-aided analysis of the signals enables the physician/nursing staff to precisely interpret the results immediately after device setup. Furthermore, ACG allows for preventive detection of pathological changes in brain tissue.\n\n"}

It is the second part of a three-episode story arc which began with the previous episode \"Sponsored Content\" and concludes with the following episode \"PC Principal Final Justice\" that together serve as the season finale. It premiered on Comedy Central on December 2, 2015. Like the previous episode, this episode continues to parody the abundance of online advertising while continuing its season-long lampoon of political correctness.\nPlot.\nAfter Kyle is called to the principal's office, he finds Mr. Mackey there instead who tells him that PC Principal has lost his mind, with him and his fellow fraternity members going on a hunger strike and that Jimmy and Leslie have both gone missing. Meanwhile, Jimmy explains about how ads have evolved over time, becoming smarter and taking human form, in which Leslie is one of them.\nRandy and his family are eating dinner when Randy proposes that the family move out of South Park because it \"sucks\" now. After dinner, Randy explains to Sharon that ever since South Park's revitalization, it has become too expensive to live in and he has taken out a second mortgage on the house to help pay for the expenses. Back at the news base, Jimmy is talking to the newsmen about how he has become attracted to Leslie, despite her being an ad. The newsmen tell him that an ad's purpose is to entice and manipulate people. Jimmy suggests posting the story to the school's newspaper, but is rebuffed as the newsmen tell him to just figure out what the ads are planning.\nAt South Park Elementary, Stan runs up to Kyle with a school newspaper clipping stating that Principal has sent Jimmy and Leslie on a Disney Cruise for good behavior, but the boys know better as Jimmy was in charge of the school newspaper before being replaced by Nathan. They go to the school newsroom to get answers but are left with nothing after Nathan starts acting stupid to throw them off-course as he directly communicates with the ads on his computer.\nMr. Garrison, Caitlyn Jenner and Principal Victoria arrive at the Whole Foods Market with disguises on and Mr. Garrison is shocked about the state of his town. Back at the news base, Jimmy's attempts to interrogate Leslie fail, leaving him to start accepting her, with the head newsman convinced that he is now \"thinking with his dick\". At Cartman's house, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and Butters search through news articles trying to solve the case, but end up at various stores after getting distracted by ads. This leads to some tension between Kyle and Stan who strongly believe the other is causing the distraction on purpose to avoid finding out the truth. Randy is ambushed by Garrison, Jenner and Victoria, who then knock him out after they discover a \"PC\" tattoo on his rump. Back at the base, Leslie tells Jimmy that Principal is the enemy and then places an ad on the newsmen's monitor so they can not see them. While isolated from the newsmen, Leslie asks Jimmy to help her escape.\nAt a motel, Randy wakes up tied to a chair being interrogated by the trio, who explain that the political correctness movement is not only happening in the United States, but internationally as well with PC Principal being the cause of it all, and Randy vows to kill him if this is true. Jimmy and Leslie attempt to escape, but are caught by the newsmen with the leader asking Officer Barbrady to kill them both, but Barbrady, not wanting to kill or injure anyone else, aids Jimmy and Leslie in their escape despite accidentally shooting a newsman in the shoulder. At the school, mutual suspicion between Kyle and Stan leads to the two to start arguing and then turning into a physical confrontation.\nAt the school newsroom, Jimmy and Leslie confront Nathan about his lies, but Leslie betrays Jimmy and brutally assaults him, revealing the fact that Nathan is one of the agents of Leslie and the other ads and proving the newsmen were correct in their warnings to Jimmy not to trust Leslie. At the fraternity house, Randy, Garrison, Jenner and Victoria discover the place abandoned before discovering a computer that Principal used to see the ad featuring him and Leslie. They come to the conclusion that Principal may be trying to help, but they get distracted after looking through the computer and end up at a store just as the boys did earlier. Leslie goes to Kyle's house to ask for his help and last four digits of his Social Security number, and they leave together.\nCritical reception.\nIGN's Max Nicholson gave the episode a 7.2 out of 10, and stated the episode \"was a little sluggish, especially in terms of the main plot. While Jimmy and Leslie's storyline made some headway on that front, the boys came up empty-handed in their investigation -- although their sudden transitions to consumerist hotspots were really funny.\" Writing for The A. V. Club, Dan Caffrey rated the episode a B, and stated in his review \"it's a chapter of the increasingly epic season 19 that relies almost entirely on cryptic intentions, shifting allegiances, and general confusion among the characters as they try to unravel who’s really behind the recent madness around town.\"\n\n"}

He conducted research in areas of personality, race, social issues, and consumer psychology.\nEarly life and education.\nJames Arthur Bayton was born on April 5, 1912 in Whitestone, Virginia to George and Helen Bayton. His father, a physician, had graduated from the medical school at Howard University. Bayton graduated from Temple University’s high school in 1931 and subsequently matriculated at Howard University as a Chemistry major. Bayton began his undergraduate career planning to go into medicine, however, taking psychology courses taught by Francis Sumner, Max Meenes, and Frederick Watts sparked Bayton's interest in the behavioral sciences. During his undergraduate career, Bayton was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Bayton graduated from Howard in 1935 with a B.A in psychology and began his M.S. studies at Howard. After graduating from the M.S. program, Bayton began further graduate study at Colombia University, where he was taught by R. S. Woodworth and A. T. Poffenberger. When Bayton’s father died, Bayton moved back to Philadelphia in order to be closer to his family. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and continued his graduate studies under psychologists such as L. Witmer, S. W. Fernberger, M. G. Preston, and M. Viteles. While conducting his doctorate studies, Bayton was offered a teaching position at Virginia State College. Partly due to the financial devastation of the Great Depression, Bayton delayed his graduate studies and became an associate professor of psychology from 1939 to 1943. During this time he published several papers, and was finally awarded his Ph.D. in psychology in 1943.\nCareer.\nFrom 1943-1945, during World War II, Bayton worked as a social service analyst for the U.S Department of Agriculture. Afterward, he became a professor of psychology at Southern University in Louisiana. He taught at Morgan State College in Maryland in 1946 and returned to Howard University as a professor in 1947, where he worked for the remainder of his life. He was the head of the Psychology Department from 1966–1970, as well as a graduate research professor from 1982-1988. From 1948-1953, Bayton also worked part-time in the U.S Department of Agriculture conducting research on consumer behavior. While working at the USDA, Bayton headed a psychological research program focused on policy development and program evaluation, as well as survey programs.\nWhile working as a professor at Howard, Bayton also served as the vice president of National Analysts, Inc. from 1953–1962 and 1966–1967, the vice president of Universal Marketing Research, Inc. from 1962–1966, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution from 1967–1968, and a staff psychologist at Chilton Research Services from 1968-1976. Working in these positions, he contributed to over 70 corporate sponsored projects. He conducted survey and marking research and focused his work on consumer psychology. He conducted research for Dupont, IMB, Armstrong Cork, Chrysler, Eli Lilly, Curtis Publishing, Johnson and Johnson, Schick, Pet Milk, American Dairy Association, Federal Reserve Board, Smith Kline, Rench, Proctor and Gamble, and the Office of Navel Research. He also was a member of the Research Advisory Committee, Social Security Administration, the United States Department of Health Education and Welfare, and the Advisory Committee on Agricultural Science in theDepartment of Agriculture. He was also the chairman of a committee designed to evaluate equal employment opportunity policies in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\nBayton was an expert witness for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in several cases of school desegregation and job discrimination. He also served as an expert witness for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. He played an important role in cases of the desegregation of Arlington and Roanoke schools after the “massive resistance” to desegregation headed by U.S Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr. He also led desegregation sessions for government agriculture extension systems. Continuing in this line of work, Bayton assessed urban police complaint boards, summer youth programs, community relations, and civil rights commissions in relational to desegregation policies. Throughout his career, Bayton directed over 50 government-sponsored projects. Bayton was a fellow of the American Psychological Association, the American Marketing Association, and the National Academy of Public Administration.\nSelected publications.\nBayton addressed overlap in issues of race and class in his 1956 study, “Race-Class Stereotypes.” 92 White and 180 Black college students were asked to choose five adjectives, from a list of 85 words, that described \"upper-class white Americans\", \"upper-class Negroes\", \"lower class white Americans\", and \"lower-class Negroes\" respectively. Generally, the upper-class was characterized as “intelligent, ambitious, industrious, neat, and progressive”, while the lower-class was considered to be “ignorant, lazy, loud, and physically dirty.” The only race difference noted was that White subjects characterized Blacks as musical and ostentatious regardless of class. Overall, the assignment of stereotypes varied more due to class than race. In other words, there were more differences between upper-class and lower class stereotypes than stereotypes between different races of the same class. Bayton suggested race differences in stereotyping tasks were partially the product of assumed class differences.\nIn another study conducted by Bayton regarding race and class, 80 Black and 74 White college students were asked to assign traits (chosen from a list of 80 adjectives) to describe the Black lower class, the Black middle class, the White lower class, and the White middle class. The students were asked to choose five or fewer traits for each group and rate the traits on a scale from -5 to +5. Both Whites and Blacks assigned more advantageous traits to the middle as opposed to the lower class (though the effect was larger for White subjects).\nIn his study, “Negro perception of Negro and white personality traits,” Bayton had the Guilford-Zimmermann Temperament Survey administered to 240 Black students at Howard University. The subjects were prompted to answer in the way that they thought the \"average Negro male\", \"average Negro female\", \"average White male\", or \"average White female\" would respond. The survey addressed aspects of temperament such as emotional stability, thoughtfulness, and sociability. The results indicated better personality adjustment when the participants were asked to answer as if they were White. Bayton theorized that this tendency to associate positive temperament with Whites may have resulted from an inclination to “idealize the aggressor” and “incorporate his negative views” towards views of the minority group.\nBayton was prominent amongst the psychologists of his time in his efforts to advance minority group participation in professional psychology. In his article, “Minority groups and careers in psychology” he reported on the National Institute of Mental Health conference in 1969. The major topic discussed at this conference was the issue of how to produce more Black and minority Ph.D.s in psychology. Bayton addressed the need for an increased number of minority psychologists in the field in order to develop psychological programs focused on the needs of minority groups. He also referenced the importance of equal opportunity in the field. He reviewed the obstacles to increasing the number of minority psychologists in the field, such as the perception amongst students that psychology is a risky or nontraditional route for a minority member to pursue professionally. He claimed that these students had to be shown that possibilities exist in psychology for minority students, perhaps through the use of brochures or films to be circulated at various institutions. While graduate programs were attempting to recruit Black students in psychology, Bayton suggested that undergraduate psychology programs needed to increase their efforts to attract Black students to the field. He also addressed the issue of quality of education and lack of resources at primarily black institutions. Bayton suggested an attempt to gain federal and private funding for black students at predominately black colleges in order to ensure competent faculty and adequate resources. He proposed requesting funding to create summer programs for undergraduates that could aid in exposure to psychology for minority students at schools lacking psychology programs. He also emphasized the need to continue holding conferences of this nature in the future.\nIn another paper, “Reflections and Suggestions for Further Study Concerning the Higher Education of Negroes,” Bayton reported on another conference that took place in April, 1967. He addressed similar issues regarding how to improve the state of affairs for Black students in higher education.\nThroughout his career, Bayton conducted significant research in the area of consumer behavior. His paper, “Motivation, Cognition, Learning—Basic Factors in Consumer Behavior,” drew attention to the role of psychological theories as lenses for research in consumer behavior. While he acknowledged that marketing at the time addressed psychological theories of motivation, he claimed that theories of cognition and learning were neglected in consumer behavior research. Bayton explained the importance of cognitive processes in consumer behavior, for one, by explaining what determines whether or not we remember a particular product. In addressing theories of learning, Bayton outlined the role of reinforcement in determining whether a consumer will purchase a good repeatedly and explained the formation of consumer habits as a lessening of conscious decision-making while making a purchase.\nOther research contributions made by Bayton pertained to sex differences in decision making, issues of race in military settings, Blacks’ decision making in dialysis, Black attitudes regarding kidney transplantation, and Blacks’ blood donation and organ and tissue transplantation.\nLegacy.\nBayton’s research interests were widespread. He furthered psychological research in areas of personality, race, social issues, and consumer psychology. His research was generally of an applied nature, and thus, his efforts helped increase the scope and depth of applied work in the field of psychology. In particular, several studies conducted by Bayton foreshadowed the emergence of system-justification theory, which addresses the tendency to support the status-quo or the “system,” even when the “system” may not be beneficial to an individual or group. In particular, the idea of out-group favoritism (a subset of system-justification theory), or viewing a high-status group positively and one’s own low-status group more negatively, emerges in Bayton’s research. In his study, “Negro perception of Negro and white personality traits,” he found that Black participants perceived Whites as having more positive temperaments than Blacks. He theorized that this bias resulted from a tendency to “idealize the aggressor” and “incorporate his negative views” into participants’ views of their minority group. In other words, out-group favoritism emerged in this study, and the participants appeared to support a racial hierarchy, or “system,” that was not beneficial to these subjects. Additionally, in another of Bayton’s studies, “Evaluative Race-Class Stereotypes by Race and Perceived Class of Subjects,” subjects assigned more advantageous traits to the middle as opposed to the lower class regardless of their own class. This study also illustrates a tendency for people to justify the \"system\", or in other words, support the American ideal of a social meritocracy whether or not this \"system\" is truly just or beneficial to them.\nAdditionally, Bayton made important efforts throughout his career to increase the number of minorities in psychology and improve educational opportunities for Black people.\nAccording to Sherman Ross and Leslie H. Hicks of Howard University, Bayton was “always responsive to students and colleagues” and was “never too busy or uninterested.” They also described him as a “model professor and researcher.” \n\n"}

It featured a good amount of Hong Kong's most popular recording acts and attractions in it's catalogue.\nBackground.\nDiamond Records was an independent label which was established in or around 1960 by Portuguese merchant, Ren da Silva. In the early 1960s, they produced a run of albums that featured original Mandarin and English compositions. Also English songs were sung in Mandarin and Mandarin songs were sung in English. Two recording artists that were an example of this were Kong Ling and Mona Fong. Both Ling and Fong had Hong Kong's leading pianist Celso Carrillo as arranger on their early Diamond albums.\nAffiliations.\nIn the early 1960s, Diamond was the only record pressing in the area at the time. It handled Mercury Record Corporation product on a licensing agreement basis. Taking a trip to the U.S., managing director da Silva visited the Chicago Mercury headquarters in August 1961 to discuss expansion in the area for manufacturing plant and distribution facilities. He also was in the U.S. to meet with Willem Langenberg the head of Philips group to discuss the coordination of a three way arrangement that would involve Mercury, Philips and Diamond.\nArtists.\nRock bands.\nIn the mid-1960s the label started taking on guitar driven bands such as Philip Chan and the Astronotes, Danny Diaz and the Checkmates, Teddy Robin and the Playboys, and The Anders Nelsson group. Later on, other bands such as the Sam Hui fronted Lotus, The Mystics, The Zoundcrackers, D’Topnotes, The Downbeats, Joe Jr. and the Side Effects, Mod East, Sons of Han, and The Menace had recordings issued on the label. \nArrangers and session musicians.\nCelso Carrillo.\nCelso Carrillo, a pianist from the Philippines was born on January 9, 1924. Along with Tony Carpio, Andy Hidalgo, and Nick Domingo, he was one of the many musicians from the Philippines that had made careers in Hong Kong. He had worked as an arranger, backing musician on various recordings by artists on the Diamond label. For a period of time, he was Hong Kong's leading pianist His band backed Kong Ling on her \"Hong Kong Presents ... Off-Beat Cha Cha\" album. In addition to playing piano and handling the arrangements, he also played conga and cow bell on various tracks. Another album for Diamond which he worked on, which was in the same vein as Kong Ling's was \"Mona Fong Meets Carding Cruz\". The backing was by the Carding Cruz band and the arrangements were by Celso Carrillo. Philippino singer Carmen Soriano, credits him with him with giving her the inspiration and training to sing when she was lacking in confidence and repertoire while in Hong Kong. At the time he was the band leader at the club and told her to give it a try just for the novelty of it. The result was her singing for a few months at the Winner House club in Hong Kong. Another singer that Carillo backed was Lita Mendoza. He died on 26th December 1988.\nAt one time he was also once president of the Philippine Musicians League.\nLater years.\nIn 1970, the label was acquired by Polydor.\n\n"}

However it took until the final league game of the season to guarantee first division football next season.

The country offers a variety of habitats for wildlife including the coast, offshore islands, mangrove areas, mudflats, salt pans, sand and gravel plains, sand dunes, mountain slopes, wadis and rocky summits.\nBecause the terrain is so varied, it supports a greater number of species of plants and animals than might have been expected in this relatively small country.\nGeography.\nThe United Arab Emirates occupy a corner of Arabia bounded by Saudi Arabia to the west and south, Oman to the east, the Gulf of Oman and Oman to the northeast and the Persian Gulf to the north. The northern coast stretches for about along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf and largely consists of salt pans that extend inland. There are numerous offshore islands, the ownership of some of which is disputed with neighbouring states. To the south is the Rub' al Khali desert, an enormous expanse of billowing sand dunes. Two large oases in the east are the Liwa Oasis, near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia, and Al-Buraimi Oasis at Al Ain. To the east the land rises and becomes mountainous, this being the northern end of the Al Hajar Mountains. Beyond these, the coast on the Gulf of Oman is rugged.\nIn the southeast of the country, near the border with Oman, there is a man-made lake, Lake Zakher, formed as a result of the release of waste water from the desalination plants on which the UAE relies for its freshwater supplies. The lake has formed as the groundwater rose, and many birds now visit the lake.\nFlora.\nA wide range of plants is associated with the many types of habitat in the United Arab Emirates. One of these types is sabkha, an area in which salty water has flooded the land shallowly and later evaporated, leaving crusty salt pans. These occur on the western part of the Gulf Coast but also among dunes inland. The plants found on their edges are salt-tolerant members of Salicornioideae and \"Zygophyllum\". At inland sites \"Zygophyllum qatarense\" predominates along with grasses such as \"Aeluropus lagopoides\" and \"Panicum turgidum\". Sandy plains further east along the coast from the sabkha region have occasional dwarf tamarisk trees and such plants as \"Salsola imbricata\" and \"Zygophyllum mandavillei\", and in coastal lagoons, and in creeks further east, the white mangrove is plentiful.\nPlants of the gravel plains further east again include \"Cornulaca monacantha\", \"Crotalaria persica\", \"Calotropis procera\" and \"Taverniera spartea\", and the parasitic desert hyacinth and the desert thumb. As the land rises up towards the mountains, the mesquite tree, an invasive species from Central America, has become established. The plains around Ras al-Khaimah in the northeast of the country, between the mountains and the sea, are the most heavily cultivated part of the country. The mountains have a cooler, more temperate climate and here there is an abundance of Alpine flowers among the rocks, on slopes and in cracks, fissures and wadis.\nFauna.\nOver four hundred species of bird have been recorded in the United Arab Emirates, with about ninety species breeding regularly in the country while the balance are winter visitors, migrants or vagrants. The country is on the crossroads of two major migratory routes, one between the Palaearctic and Africa, the other between the Near East and the Indian subcontinent, and the migrants make use of the many types of habitat available.\nAbout 250,000 waders visit the Gulf shores and mudflats at peak migration time; these include the grey plover, the greater and lesser sand plovers, the crab plover, the Kentish plover and the broad-billed sandpiper. The coast, and particularly offshore islands are used by many seabirds. About twenty to thirty percent of the world's Socotra cormorants, about 200,000 birds, breed in the United Arab Emirates, but they are under threat from fishermen who fear for their livelihoods. Sooty gulls breed here, as do red-billed tropicbirds as well as several species of tern; white-cheeked, bridled and lesser crested tern.\nA large number of passerine birds breed in the deserts, salt flats, plains, dunes and mountains. Twelve species of wheatear have been recorded in the country as well as warblers, babblers, rollers, bulbuls, the desert lark and many others. The sooty falcon overwinters in Madagascar and breeds in the United Arab Emirates. Other than this, there are only a small number of raptor species; Bonelli's eagle, barbary falcon, short-toed snake eagle, long-legged buzzard and lappet-faced vulture.\nMany of the large mammals found in the Arabian Peninsula were well-adapted to desert life in the harsh terrain, but were wiped out by human hunting in the last hundred years or so. Hunting is now banned in the United Arab Emirates, but feral goats and donkeys are plentiful and graze indiscriminately, lessening the chance for the native gazelles to recover from their reduced population sizes. Large terrestrial mammals still found in the United Arab Emirates include the Arabian tahr, the Arabian oryx, the sand gazelle and the mountain gazelle. Carnivores include the Arabian wolf, the striped hyena, the red fox, the Blanford's fox, the Rüppell's fox, the caracal, the Arabian wildcat, the sand cat and the Arabian leopard. Other mammals include the Cape hare, the Brandt's hedgehog, the desert hedgehog and the long-eared hedgehog.\nThe Egyptian fruit bat is found here during most of the year, but moves around according to the availability of fruit. Insectivorous bats include the sac-winged bat, the mouse-tailed bat and the leaf-nosed bat. Small rodents include the lesser Egyptian jerboa, the Cheesman's gerbil and the Balochistan gerbil. Rather larger rodents are the Libyan jird and the Sundevall's jird which both favour desert habitats. The Cairo spiny mouse was found in the mountains for the first time in 1995.\nOver 54 species of terrestrial reptile have been recorded in the UAE. These include a large number of lizards, found in all environments from desert, to city, to mountain-top, and a single species of worm lizard. There are thirteen species of terrestrial snake, some of the largest being the sand boa, the saw-scaled viper and the horned viper, and four species of sea snake as well as green sea turtles present in the Persian Gulf. There are two species of amphibian in the United Arab Emirates, the Arabian toad and the Dhofar toad; the former is more commonly seen as the Dhofar toad is nocturnal.\n\n"}

It is made of andesite stone, depicting a giant with a terrifying face. The style is of a dvarapala. Based on the style, it is suggested that it was made in the 10th century.\nPhysical features.\nThe face and other ornaments also suggest that it is a representation of a female \"butå\". This is unusual since most dvarapala statues show male characteristics. Arca Totok Kerot is 3 meters tall.\nThe hair is matted, covering the upper part of the back. A kind of tiara with a glimpse of skull is seen above forehead, covering also the ears. The eyes are protruding, creating a terrifying effect, as if it were angry.\nLike many other dvarapala statues, it kneels on one knee. The left knee touches the ground while the right knee is erected, on which the right hand is laid. The left hand is missing, so it is unknown if it originally held a \"gådå\" (mace) like other dvarapala statues. All hands and legs are wearing \"binggêl\" (bracelets).\nThe nipples are clearly shown on the breast, another indication that it is female. It wears a necklace of skulls, usually worn by worshippers of Durga or Shiva. A girdle is encircling its waist, on which some kind of skirt is hanging.\nDiscovery and excavation.\nThe statue was discovered in 1981.\nIn 2013, due to an imminent plan by the local government to enlarge the road near Arca Totok Kerot, an excavation was hastily carried out searching for other archaeological remains. The excavation was conducted by East Java Hall of Cultural Heritage Preservation (\"Balai Pelestarian Cagar Budaya Jawa Timur\"). The possibility was considered because dvarapala statues were usually placed to guard a temple complex or other important sites.\nThe excavation took place for six days. The team dug with average 1.5 meters into the surrounding ground, in some points even 4 meters. However, no other archaeological remains were found. Eventually the excavation was terminated and the cavities were filled. The road in front of the statue was then enlarged.\nFolklore related to the statue.\nTales were abound surrounding the statue. Some were already documented and many others were still transmitted orally. Some tales related the statue to the legendary character Calon Arang, but such connection was refuted by Timoer (1981). Others were connected to the legendary king Jayabaya (Santosa, 2005).\n\n"}

It was the second burial site of Jovan Vladimir, the ruler of Duklja (ca. 1000–1016), after his widow Kosara renewed it and transferred his remains from Prespa. The relics drew many devotees to the church, which became a center of pilgrimage. Kosara was interred in the church, at the feet of her husband, on her request. In around 1215—when Krajina was under the rule of Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanjić—the relics were presumably removed from this church and transported to Dyrrhachium by the troops of Michael I, the despot of Epirus. At that time Despot Michael had briefly captured from Serbia the city of Skadar, which is only about east of the church. The monastery was mentioned in 1417 in a Cetinje manuscript. The Balšić family reconstructed the monastery in the 15th century. The monastery became the seat of a Catholic bishopric, as part of the Catholic-Venetian expansion. The bishop, who was employed in an Orthodox region, saw resistance in the area from the Serbian Orthodox. At the beginning of the 20th century, the population surrounding the Church ruins were Muslims.\n\n"}

Directed by Mario Nalpas and Henri Étiévant and set in the West Indies, the film tells the story of a native girl named Papitou (Baker) who falls in love with a French man named André Berval (Pierre Batcheff). \nPlot.\nThe film is set in a fictional colony called Monte Puebla. Monte Puebla incorporates many colonial stereotypes, with the name suggesting that it could be a Spanish colony, the grass skirts and roofs suggesting a Polynesian influence, and the clothing being a jumble of multiple cultures. The story begins when a rich Parisian man named Marquis Sévéro wishes to marry a woman named Denise, but Denise is in love with an engineer named André Berval. In order to get rid of Berval, Marquis Sévéro sends him to the West Indies as a prospector, promising that he can marry Denise once he returns. After arriving in the West Indies, Berval meets a woman named Papitou. Papitou quickly falls in love with him, unaware of the fact that he is planning on marrying Denise upon his return to Paris. When Berval leaves the West Indies to return home Papitou follows him, despite the fact that he has a fiancé. Once she arrives in Paris, Papitou adjusts to city life and finds her true calling as a music hall performer. \nReception.\nPrior to the film's release, newspaper articles detailing Baker's tour through Europe piqued public interest.Following the film's premiere in December of 1927 in Stockholm, it received almost unanimously positive reviews from film critics. The film was screened from December 1927 until July 1928, which was considered an exceptionally long running time. Most of these positive reviews focused on Baker's body, comparing her agile movements to those of animals. Following her positive reception in \"Siren of the Tropics\" and increased public interest surrounding her, Baker published an autobiography called \"Les mémoirs de Josephine Baker.\" Following the film's very successful premiere, Baker also had a doll made in her likeness and sold in Stockholm, and starred in a toothpaste commercial. This positive reception of Baker's feature film debut set the stage for her starring roles in the films \"Zouzou\" and \"Princesse Tam-Tam\". \n\n"}

He is a real estate entrepreneur and the founder of OWN Realty and OWN Financial, with principal offices located in Miami, Florida.\nHe is also a direct descendent of the Qajar Dynasty, the Royal Family, which ruled Persia (now Iran) from 1785 to 1925.\nEarly life and Education.\nPiétro was born to Princess Shahnaz Shakoori M.D., after she moved from Iran to become a surgeon in the United States.\nIn his younger years, Piétro became fluent in English, Farsi and Spanish with some background in French and Italian. He attended preparatory school at Rumsey Hall in Washington, Connecticut and then boarding school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. After he attained his Bachelor of Science Degree from Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. Later he went on to study at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida where he attained a Master of Business Administration Degree (MBA) in International Management.\nCareer.\nAfter graduating from college, Piétro decided to open a lounge in South Beach, Miami. He co-founded W6 Lounge with two other New Yorkers, ensuring the lounge had the feel of a bar in Manhattan.\nAt the time, it was seen as one of the few upscale lounges in Miami, with regular celebrity guests. Following the completion of W6, Piétro was featured in The Miami Hurricane in 2002, discussing how its club catered for students and young professionals. Up to 2001, W6 and Piétro were regarded as a prominent entertainment figure and location in Miami around 2001.\nPiétro remained at the entertainment venue until 2004 when he left to start World Real Estate Exchange, which was a real estate brokerage founded in early 2005.

He was quoted \"“For Mexicans and Venezuelans, it’s security issues,” he said. “For Canadians and the English, it’s the exchange rate; for Russians and Germans, the strength of their economies. So there’s a lot of action.”\"\nAfter becoming an International real estate expert, Piétro was made a Certified International Property Specialist, becoming one of just over 1,000 to hold the qualification globally. His work in Miami and the surrounding Florida market, has lead him to be interviewed about the state of the American property market a number of times in recent years.\nFamily.\nPiétro is a great grandson of Mozaffar Al-Din Shah Qajar, who was the fifth Qajar king of Persia. He reigned between the years 1853 and 1907. Piétro’s maternal great grandfather Sarem Al-Saltaneh Sardar Nasser Talesh was the Vali and Hakim of Azerbaijan, Gilan, Mazandaran, Ardabil, Astara, Namin, Rasht and Talesh which made up the Northern region of Persia. After a coup in 1925, the Qajar's rule of Persia came to and end, with the new Pahlavi Dynasty re-naming the country Iran in 1935.\nHis grandfather Jalil Shakoori continued to live in Iran, and served as a Colonel under the last Shah starting in the mid-1940s.

Identical apart from their engines, they flew in mid-1930.\nDesign.\nIn 1929 Dyle and Bacalan were reformed as Société Aérienne Bordelaise (SAB) who continued to work on its predecessor's designs, distinguished by their DB numbering as well as on their own, which had AB numbers. The DB-80 originated with Dyle and Bacalan but was not flown until 1930, built by SAB. It was Dyle and Bacalan's last design and a small aircraft by their standards but maintained their all-metal tradition.\nThe DB-80 was aimed at the airmail market and was a single engine, high wing aircraft giving easy access by two port-side doors to a well lit cabin with two passenger seats and to a separate mail compartment behind them. The pilot sat ahead of the passengers under the wing leading edge. Two differently engined versions were built: the DB-80 had a Hispano-Suiza 6P six cylinder, upright water-cooled inline and the DB-81 a Lorraine 5Pc five cylinder radial engine. The latter was mounted on a hinged frame for easy servicing. The Hispano engined had a Lamblin radiator on the fuselage underside.\nThe fuselage was built around four longerons, with rectangular frames and covered in longitudinally ribbed duralumin. Its underside was smoothly bellied, its upper side flat. In plan its taper was delayed until aft of the cabin. Its empennage was conventional, with a straight tapered, blunt topped fin and unbalanced rudder, the latter cut away at its base to allow for movement of the one-piece elevator mounted on a triangular tailplane at mid-fuselage height. Like the fuselage, all the tail surfaces were covered with ribbed duralumin.\nThe DB-80 had a fixed, tailwheel undercarriage with track of .The mainwheels were independently mounted and fitted with brakes. Each axle was mounted at the lower vertex of a triangular box acting as a cantilever leg, with its upper side hinged from the fuselage longerons. The strengthened forward edge of the structure extended above the hinge and connected to an elastic block housed in a reinforced transverse beam which passed under the cockpit, incorporating shock absorbers.\nThe DB-80's high, cantilever wing was unusual both in its construction and high aspect ratio of 9. In plan it was straight tapered on both edges but with semi-elliptical tips curved particularly on the trailing edges, where its ailerons were full span and broad. The wing was built around three spars, rather than the traditional one or two and the detail of their caps or flanges, rather than the shape of the longitudinal braces or ribs, determined the airfoil profile. A similar but not identical wing structure was used on the Dyle et Bacalan DB-20.\nDevelopment.\nIn late March 1930 the DB-80's test flights were awaiting better weather; a month later tests were underway but the first flight did not take place until 27 June 1930. The Lorraine powered DB-81 flew in August, after which testing of the pair continued successfully though interrupted by SAB test pilot Charles Deschamps' absence at Villacoublay for official trials of the DB-20. In October the DB-80 was re-engined with a Lorraine and renamed DB-81.\nThere is no record of any further examples being built nor of measured performance figures.\n\n"}

It aims to benefit students in East Africa by improving education in its partner schools, and to give personal development opportunities to UK university students. It was established in Kisii in 1990 as The Kenya Project. Since then it has expanded to two further sites: Kakamega in Kenya and Mbarara in Uganda, and now works with around 30 schools each summer.\nSummer project.\nStudent volunteers, known as Project Workers, spend ten weeks during their summer vacation living, either in a pair or trio, in a rural community in Kenya or Uganda. They work in partnership with the school management and local community to identify the most important needs for the school, and how they can best be addressed. These might include investing in sustainable resources, such as library books, science equipment and small infrastructure projects, helping with school management issues, and setting up co-curricular activities. Schools typically receive a minimum of two years of investment from the charity, before being reassessed to establish whether they would benefit from further investment. Volunteers fundraise money in the UK before their visit to cover the costs of the project, which includes the school investment, as well as their own flights, accommodation and living costs.\nSchools.\nIn Kenya EPAfrica works primarily with government funded District Schools. These are schools which any students with acceptable grades can attend, and which do not charge fees for tuition. In Uganda the charity also works with Technical schools which provide more vocational studies. The schools tend to be of medium size, in very rural locations, and to be short of resources, but with the potential to improve. Any school meeting the basic criteria can apply and most will receive a visit during the summer to assess their eligibility. In total EPAfrica has worked with over 100 schools in East Africa, investing more than £200,000.\nUK operations.\nEducation Partnerships Africa is a registered charity in the UK. It is run and managed entirely by volunteers, the majority of whom are alumni (i.e. former Project Workers). Each university has its own University Committee, which is responsible for recruiting Project Workers and running training for them throughout the year.\nThe central charity is made up of a number of workstreams, such as Communications, IT and Finance, each headed up by a Workstream Lead. These are overseen by a Management Committee, made up of six volunteers. The strategic direction and governance of the organisation is overseen by a Board of Trustees, all of whom are also volunteers.\nAccording to the Charity Commission the charity has an annual turnover of over £100,000, the majority of which is fundraised by its Project Workers. Because it is run entirely by volunteers the vast majority of this annual turnover is spent directly on its East Africa operations.\nHistory.\nThe charity began life in 1990 as The Kisii Project. In the early 1990s a group of Cambridge University students began teaching in a school in the Kisii area of Western Kenya. By 1995, Kisii Project had been incorporated into Link Africa (now Link Community Development) and extended to another two schools in the region. A few years later, the focus of the project was switched to resource investment to ensure sustainability.\nIn 2002 the project expanded to Oxford University and started sending 20 Project Workers a year to work in 10 schools in Kisii. The two university projects combined as a registered charity under the name The Kenya Project, which was later changed to Kenya Education Partnerships. From 2009 the charity began a period of expansion of its UK operations to a number of London universities, starting by recruiting Project Workers from University College London; the project went on to accept applications from all universities in London.\nIn 2008, violence following the disputed 2007 elections in Kenya made it unsafe for volunteers to be sent to Kenya so the charity moved its operations to Uganda for one summer. In 2010 it expanded to working in Kakamega, also in Western Kenya, and in 2013 it permanently expanded its operations to Mbarara in Uganda.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48689505","title":"Lavant House","body":"\nLavant House\n\nLavant House (or West Lavant House) is an old English estate.\nHistory.\nThe earliest unarguable documentary reference to Lavant House dates to 1762-3. Architectural analysis of the building, its photographic depictions and an eighteenth century watercolour suggest that it was built between 1707 and 1725. The Richard Budgen map of Sussex (1723–24) shows two houses considered worthy of note in the manor of West Lavant, of which one is undoubtedly West Lavant Farm (built in 1711) while the other is likely Lavant House, given that no remains or records document another large house in the area.\nSir John Miller.\nIts first definite owner was Sir John Miller (the 4th Baronet) whose family had been prominent in Chichester first as justices of the peace and mayors then becoming members of parliament from the later 17th century. Sir John had enclosed the ‘park’ at West Lavant by 1740 after which date he may have resided in the first form of Lavant House, its central section.\nThe Duke of Newcastle’s brother (Henry Pelham) wrote to the Duke saying \"you know my thoughts on Sir John he is as friendly and honest as the day is long\". This has to be balanced with the fact that the Second Duke of Richmond could relate to the Duke of Newcastle that Sir John had stated that he did not care a fart for [his father-in-law] Dr. Combs. Sir John is believed to be depicted as a lesser figure in a 1759 painting by George Stubbs showing the Third Duke of Richmond out hunting (this hangs in the front hall at Goodwood House). He died in 1772 and his relict Dame Susanna remained at Lavant House until her death in 1788 when the house was put on the market by her eldest Son (Sir Thomas Miller) who had by then moved to live in Hampshire. This was the advertisement in the \"The European magazine, and London Review\".\nThird Duke of Richmond.\nIn 1791 the house was bought by The Third Duke of Richmond who rented it to Lord Bathurst. In 1798 the Duke started work on the house. Apparently this was when the house was reoriented to face north (maps show the drive originally approaching from the south). He appears to have died (in 1806) while the project was underway.\nThe next inhabitant was Henriette Ann Le Clerc, now thought to be the Duke’s illegitimate daughter. Henriette was brought from France by his sister, Lady Louisa Conolly, in 1778 at age 5 to live at her Goodwood estate. His will named her the first beneficiary, receiving life tenure of West Lavant House and Park and other lands and farms. She married Colonel (later General) John Dorrien on 28 March 1808. John and Henriette’s only child, Charles (the traditional Lennox family name), was born in Lavant in January 1809. Following John’s death in 1825, Henriette ran her estate, which she mentions in a series of letters to the Fifth Duke. She remained much of the time at Lavant. Forty years after moving into Lavant House, the Agricultural Gazette announced her death on January 6, 1846.\nThe house then returned to the Goodwood Estate and was rented to a series of tenants.\nTwentieth century.\nIn 1907 the house was sold in 1907 to Mr Morrison and family. He is probably responsible for the dining room decoration.\nThe house was then sold to Major Henry Frederic Low and family. In 1921 his relict sold it to Major Julian Day and Isabella. She then sold the building to the school.\n\n"}

Formed in November 1938, 72nd (Middlesex) was the third of a new group of three TA searchlight regiment raised by the Royal Artillery (previous TA S/L units had all been part of the Royal Engineers and/or converted from infantry battalions). It consisted of HQ and Nos 465–467 Companies (later Batteries) based at a newly built drill hall at Vicarage Road, Heston. Shortly afterwards the regiment moved to Twickenham. It was equipped with the new '90 cm Projector Anti Aircraft', a smaller and lighter piece of equipment than previous searchlights, with a more powerful high current density arc lamp with automatic carbon feed.\nWorld War II.\nAnti-Aircraft Command mobilised in August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September, and the regiment took its place in 47th AA Brigade, part of 5th AA Division tasked with defending Southampton.\nSouthampton was a regular target for raids by the German \"Luftwaffe\" during the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940, but by November 1940 the regiment had transferred to 40 AA Bde in 2nd AA Division in the Midlands. It had the responsibility for covering RAF airfields in the East Midlands and continued in that role throughout the Blitz of 1940–41.\nAs the threat from the Luftwaffe waned in 1944, the War Office warned in June that AA Command would have to release manpower to provide reinforcements to 21st Army Group fighting in . The run-down began in September 1944, and 72nd S/L Rgt was placed in 'suspended animation' in that month, with its personnel being posted away.\nPostwar.\nWhen the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 72nd S/L Rgt was reformed at Twickenham as 607 Searchlight Regiment, RA (Middlesex), forming part of 67 AA Bde (the former 41 AA Bde based at Shepherds Bush). In 1949 the regiment's role was altered and it was redesignated 607th (Mixed) Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, RA (Middlesex) ('Mixed' denoting that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit).\nAA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, and 607 LAA/SL Regiment was disbanded at the same time.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48689766","title":"1958 Targa Florio","body":"\n1958 Targa Florio\n\nThe 42° Targa Florio took place on 11 May, on the Circuito Piccolo delle Madonie, (Sicily, Italy). It was the third round of the F.I.A. World Sports Car Championship, which was running to new regulations introduced at the beginning of the season. The most influential of these regulations changes would be the 3.0 litre engine size limit. The event returned to the championship for the first time since 1955, following the demise of the Mille Miglia and the ban on road racing on mainland Italy. But such outcry did not deter Vincenzo Florio from holding his event on the traditional 45 mile mountainous circuit.\nReport.\nEntry.\nA massive total of 65 racing cars were registered for this event, of which 53 arrived for practice. Only these, only 38 started the long distance race on the public roads of Sicily. This, the 42nd edition of the event, saw a change on the nature of the race. Two drivers would be permitted now and the limit set so no driver would drive more than seven laps out of the total race distance of 14. So, it ensured no single driver would be able to complete the whole race.\nThe first two events of the season, the 1000 km Buenos Aires and 12 Hours of Sebring ended with victory for Phil Hill and Peter Collins, for Scuderia Ferrari. As Hill and Collins also won the last race of the previous season, the Venezuelan Grand Prix they’ve now won three races in a row for the Scuderia. With these new rules, and Maserati on the brink of financial crisis, Scuderia Ferrari would head the Italian challenge. Ferrari had four works 250 TRs in Sicily, Hill/Collins, Mike Hawthorn/Wolfgang von Trips, Luigi Musso/Olivier Gendebien and Gino Munaron/Wolfgang Seidel. Opposition would no longer come from Maserati… but from Porsche and Aston Martin.\nDavid Brown sent just one Aston Martin DBR1 over from England for Stirling Moss/Tony Brooks, while Porsche arrived with three different cars, a 356A Carrera, a 550 RS and a 718 RSK, for their squad of drivers led by Jean Behra and Giorgio Scarlatti. They were joined by a fleet of privateer drivers in their Alfa Romeos, Oscas and other mainline sportscars.\nQualifying.\nPrior to the race, there was no formal practice held, but Sergio Der Stephanian was killed in a pre-race accident, following a collision with a sand-laden lorry. He died shortly after in hospital.\nRace.\nWith each lap 45 miles in length, the race covered a total of 14 laps, or 630 miles, the Targa Florio is unlike any other sports car race. Littered with switchback turns, blind corners and a straight nearly four miles longer than Circuit de la Sarthe’s Mulsanne, the Targa was a fearsome thing to behold.\nDay of the race would be sunny and warm, with the first of the cars leaving the small village of Cerda, one-by-one, at 40 seconds intervals. It was clear right at the start that something was amiss for most of the competitors, as more than a few would be off the pace, while other would be off the road, in verges trying to repair their cars and get back into the race. Jean Behra would spin his Porsche 718 RSK. Moss would damage a wheel when he went off the road. Meanwhile, von Trips damaged his Ferrari heavily and returned to the pits dragging bit of his car along the ground. It seemed that everyone was struggling over the mountain roads, except one, Musso.\nMusso was setting an incredibly pace. He started last of the big works entrants, but at the end of the first lap, he would be first. Being in the lead, he set about performing an error-free drive. Moss would be on the hunt in his Aston, ever-impressive sliding around the corners, kicking up gravel everywhere and carrying on without any trouble whatsoever, following that earlier incident. He would break the lap record, lapping more than a minute faster than Musso. But the Italian had already done all of his head work. He led and held steady before handing the car over to Gendebien.\nWith Gendebien now the car, Moss would take his Aston even faster, but it came at a price. After five laps, the gearbox gave up and Moss was out of the race, before Brooks had a chance to race. Despite the retirement of the sole Aston Martin, the circuit maintained the pressure on the factory efforts. Hill would end up in a ditch, losing valuable time trying to get out and back on his way. As for the Belgian, he was driving smartly, keeping the car on the road, and in the lead. He was just a few laps before returning the car back to Musso. This was the only Ferrari not under heavy pressure from Behra. The nimble little RSK was providing its self on the winding roads, and joining the battle for a spot in the top three.\nMusso held a commanding lead, despite the advances of Behra. But Musso was not immune to trouble. Only three laps from the end, there was trouble. He appeared to be off the pace, lapping four minutes slower than previously. He was happy to make it back to the pits, as the brake fluid had leaked out of its reservoir. He had no brakes. It was reported that he completed the descent out of the mountains by staying in low gear. In any other race, this would have spelled the end, however, Musso and Gendebien had controlled the race right from the start. Such was their lead, the Ferrari mechanics repaired the car, Gendebien got back in the car for the remaining laps, still with a three-minute lead.\nNow the leaders were out of trouble, their team-mates von Trips and Hawthorn were not. They were in second place, but with Behra back in the Porsche and absolutely flying. Following a pitshop, the margin between the Ferrari and Porsche would be practically nothing. There was no stopping Behra, and he continued to up his pace and Hawthorn could not response. Starting the 14th and last lap, Behra’s pace had meant he was now ahead.\nOut in front, Gendebien brought the 250 TR home, to record a brilliant victory. Though Moss had set a new lap record in his Aston, the race had been dominated from the very beginning by Musso. Car number 106, took an impressive victory, winning in a time 10hr 37:58.1, averaging a speed of 59.251 mph. Second place went to the Porsche of Behra and Giorgio Scarlatti, albeit over 5½ minutes adrift. The podium was complete by second Scuderia Ferrari of von Trips and Hawthorn, who were 54 secs behind in third.\nOfficial Classification.\n\"Class Winners are in Bold text.\"\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48689801","title":"Madeleine Dior","body":"\nMadeleine Dior\n\nMarie Madeleine Juliette Martin, who was born in Angers, France, in 1879 and died in Granville (French department of Manche) in 1931, was the wife of the industrialist Maurice Dior. She was also the mother of the grand couturier Christian Dior and the French Resistance member Catherine Dior.\nBiography.\nMadeleine Martin was the daughter of a lawyer from Angers and Juliette Surosne, originally from the department of Calvados, France. Monsieur Martin died young and Madeleine was brought up by her mother.\nIn 1898, at the age of nineteen, she married Maurice Dior who was six years her senior. The couple moved to the center of Granville in the department of Manche, where Maurice Dior had grown up. They had five children: Raymond in 1899, Christian in 1905, Jacqueline in 1909, Bernard in 1910, and Ginette, known as Catherine, in 1917.\nIn 1905, to satisfy Madeleine, who did not like the house in the center of town, the Dior family purchased a property that was still in Granville but on the edge of a cliff, facing the sea. This windswept villa was called \"Les Rhumbs\", named after the thirty-two divisions of the wind rose. It had a large piece of adjoining land which Madeleine Dior transformed into a southern-style garden, overcoming the hostility of the winds blowing in from the sea to grow delicate plants.\nIn 1910, taking advantage of the revenue from Maurice Dior's company which was enjoying great success, the family moved to Rue Richard Wagner in Paris, since renamed Rue Albéric Magnard. Madeleine Dior excelled as the lady of the house and a woman of taste, decorating the apartment in the Louis XVI-Passy style fashionable at the time. She surpassed herself when holding dinners served by butlers in white gloves, and her bouquets were much admired by her guests.\nIn 1914, the family decided to take refuge from the war and returned to live in the Granville villa, which had been their holiday home since 1910. Like all society ladies in the region, Madeleine Dior participated in the war effort. In his autobiography, Christian Dior remembers this period when women were occupied \"with making shredded cloth bandages, hospitals, letters from the front and recreation sessions for the injured.\" The family returned to live in Paris in 1918, not far from the apartment where they had lived before the war.\nIn 1930, Bernard, the second youngest of the family, was affected by a serious nervous disorder. Madeleine Dior, doubtless worn down by what was happening to her son, died the following year. Jacques Bonjean, a gallery owner and friend of Christian Dior, described her as an \"...elegant and slender woman, sometimes distant, always graceful.\"\nThe \"Les Rhumbs\" garden in Granville.\nThroughout her life, Madeleine Dior lived out her passion for flowers through the transformation of the windswept land surrounding her villa in Granville into a beautiful English-style garden. First she had a veranda added to the façade of the house, which sheltered a winter garden, and planted a small wood of umbrella pines to protect her plants from the wind. This was a bold choice of tree for the Normandy coast. She also had windbreak walls put up to protect the property, and finally she had a greenhouse built where the plants were overwintered. On the advice of Christian Dior, the greenhouse was replaced in 1925 by a pergola and pool; a rose garden was planted nearby a short while later. The creation of the garden became a two-person job, which created a bond between Madeleine Dior and her son: the latter organized it by positioning the features, while she took care of the planting. The result was a complex planting scheme that sheltered the most fragile flowers from the wind: \"\"Madeleine Dior's planting formed curtains of shielding greenery, so that the second was more precious and the third consisted of plants that it would have been impossible to grow here: geraniums, roses, jasmine... All these protective screens created layers, structures and motif effects,\" explains the garden's current landscape gardener.\nJames de Coquet, journalist for \"Le Figaro\", remembered being amazed by his visit to \"Les Rhumbs\" in 1929: \"I complimented Madame Dior on her beautiful garden. I told her she must have an excellent gardener.\"\"\nIn 1997, the villa, which had been purchased by the town of Granville in 1932, became the Musée Christian Dior. The garden, Madeleine Dior's life work, is one of the few \"artistic gardens\" of the early 20th century to have been preserved. For student landscape gardners, it is also an exceptional subject of study.\nInfluence on the work of Christian Dior.\nMadeleine Dior was particularly close to her son Christian, the future couturier: in the eyes of her other children, he was her \"favorite\" and he followed her everywhere, from her Granville garden to Orêve, her favorite Parisian florist, and the dressmaker Rosine Perrault. Madeleine Dior was a close follower of fashion, as demonstrated by a Roaring Twenties dress that she designed, which is exhibited in the Granville museum.\nThe couturier remembered his mother when, years after her death, on the eve of his first runway show, he was looking at the façade of the House that bore his name on Avenue Montaigne and exclaimed: \"If Mother had lived, I would never have dared.\" In the same way that we sense the presence of Charles Baudelaire's mother, Caroline, in his work and the influence of Jeanne, Marcel Proust's mother, in his, Madame Dior had a profound effect on her son's entire career. Regarding the Granville house, Christian Dior wrote: \"\"I have the tenderest, most magical memories of it. Not only that; my life, my style, owe nearly everything to its location and architecture,\" and \"...(it) was pebbledashed in a very soft pink, blended with gray gravel, and these two colors have remained my favorite shades in couture.\"\" But it was above all his mother's garden that made a deep impression on the couturier. Having spent his childhood learning the names of flowers and their descriptions from horticulture catalogs, Christian Dior drew inspiration from them to create the silhouettes that would lead to his success in 1947 with the \"Corolle\" line. The decor of the Diors' apartment in La Muette, Paris, was also imprinted on the couturier's imagination: reference is made to it in the Louis XVI style which inspired the interiors of the Dior boutiques. Finally, it was Madeleine Dior's look that the couturier remembered when he invented the famous New Look with its nipped in waist, pronounced hips and emphasized bust recalling the feminine silhouettes of the Belle Époque. Long after the couturier's death, the House of Dior continues to pay tribute to this muse, as in the Fall-Winter 2005 runway show, where a Belle Époque-inspired dress was named \"Madeleine\".\n\n"}

His mother Nina Ivanovna Buiko was a ballet dancer. His maternal grandfather Ivan Petrovich Buiko came from an old Russian family and served as a colonel in the Imperial Russian Army and a commandant in Warsaw. He joined Bolsheviks in 1917. Georgi's father Emil Iosifovich Yungvald-Khilkevich was an acclaimed theater director and one of the founders of the Uzbek National Theater of Opera and Ballet (later Navoi Theater).

The temple is maintained and administered by the Kunnakudi Thiruvannamalai Mutt Adikam, while the rock-cut caves are maintained as a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of India.\nLegend.\nThe place was originally called Kundrakudi as it was located in a hill (\"Kundram\" means hill in Tamil), which with the period of time became Kunnakudi. It is also called by other names like Mayuragiri, Mayilmalai, Arasavaram and Krishanagaram as the hill resembles the shape of a peacock. As per Hindu legend, sage Agasthya is believed to have worshipped Murugan at this place. As per another legend, Sooran, the demon king infuriated peacock, the sacred vehicle of Murugan. He told the bird that Garuda, the sacred vehicle of Vishnu and Swan, the sacred vehicle of Saraswati could travel faster than it. The peacock swallowed Garuda and the swan in anger. Vishnu prayed to Muruga to retrieve his vehicle back from the peacock, who readily acceded to the request. The peacock, realising its mistake, prayed Muruga by doing penance at this place.\nArchitecture.\nThe temple is located in Kundrakudi, in the outskirts of Karaikudi in Sivaganga district in Tamil Nadu on the road from Tirupattur to Karaikudi.

The first two caves have intricate rock-cut sculptures and Dvarapalas on either side of the sanctum, while the third one is plain. There are various sculpted images of Vishnu, Durga, Lingodbhava, Harihara. The image of Dvarapalas in the caves, on either sides of the sanctum, with each leaning in the direction facing the sanctum, are found to be the earliest representation of the images. These are not found in Pallava architecture, which precedes the Pandyas. The caves are considered one of the major specimens of rock-cut architecture of the Pandyas, counted along with Vettuvan Koil, Thirumalaipuram and Thiruparankundram.\nCulture.\nThe temple priests perform the \"pooja\" (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: \"Kalasandhi\" at 6:00 a.m., \"Uchikala poojai\" at 11:00 a.m., \"Sayarakshai\" at 6:00 p.m., and \"Arthajama Pooja\" at 7:45 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: \"alangaram\" (decoration), \"neivethanam\" (food offering) and \"deepa aradanai\" (waving of lamps) for the presiding deities. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6:30 am - 12:00 pm and 5 - 8:30 pm on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings.

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48690005","title":"Films Albatros","body":"\nFilms Albatros\n\nFilms Albatros was a French film production company established in 1922. It was formed by a group of White Russian exiles who had been forced to flee following the 1917 Russian Revolution and subsequent Russian Civil War. Initially the firm's personnel consisted mainly of Russian exiles, but over time French actors and directors were employed by the company. Its operations continued until the late 1930s.\nHistory.\nFaced with increasingly difficult working conditions in Russia after the revolution of 1917, the film producer Joseph Ermolieff decided to move his operations to Paris where he had connections with the Pathé company. Arriving in 1920 with a group of close associates, Ermolieff took over a studio in Montreuil-sous-Bois in the eastern suburbs of Paris and began making films through his company Ermolieff-Cinéma. His co-founder of the company was Alexandre Kamenka, another Russian exile, and when in 1922 Ermolieff moved to Germany, Kamenka, together with his colleagues Noë Bloch and Maurice Hache, took over the company and re-established it as the Société des Film Albatros. He also set up a distribution company called Les Films Armor in order to control the distribution of his own films. Various explanations have been given for the choice of the name Albatros: the name of a boat which brought some of the emigrés from Russia; a symbol of White Russia; an incident with an albatros on the journey. As well as adopting the image of the albatros as its symbol, the company took the motto \"Debout dans la tempête\" (\"upright in the storm\").\nAmong the group of Russian artists who stayed to work with Albatros were the directors Victor Tourjansky and Alexandre Volkoff, the art director Alexandre Lochakoff, the costume designer Boris Bilinsky, and the actors Ivan Mosjoukine, Nathalie Lissenko, Nicolas Koline, and Nicolas Rimsky. Although this Russian company initially favoured Russian themes, Kamenka quickly realised the need for greater integration with French film production, and they turned increasingly to French subjects. In 1924 a number of Kamenka's Russian associates left Albatros, and Kamenka offered opportunities to several innovative French film-makers including Jean Epstein, Jacques Feyder, Marcel L'Herbier and René Clair. \nKamenka's production policy combined prestige projects with openly commercial films, and his consistent record made him the most successful French producer during the 1920s, according to Charles Spaak, who came to the company as a script-writer in 1928. Kamenka successfully achieved international distribution for many of his films (even in Soviet Russia with which his company had so little political sympathy, and from 1927 he entered into co-production arrangements with production companies in other European countries, driven by growing financial difficulties in the French film industry. The arrival of sound pictures posed a serious difficulty for Albatros which had hitherto relied considerably upon Russian actors, especially Mosjoukine whose accent precluded a successful transition into the talking era.\nThe company's output diminished in the 1930s, but it achieved one further artistic success of note when Jean Renoir joined them for his 1936 adaptation of Gorki's \"Les Bas-fonds\". By this time, Albatros was the longest surviving film company operating in France, but with the outbreak of World War II, Kamenka wound up the company which had remained particularly associated with silent cinema.\n\n"}

It was issued by Lev Karakhan, deputy commissioner for foreign affairs for Soviet Russia. The manifesto offered to relinquish various rights Russia had obtained by treaty in China, including extraterritoriality, economic concessions, and Russia's share of the Boxer indemnity. These and similar treaties had been denounced by Chinese nationalists as \"unequal.\" The manifesto created a favorable impression of Russia and Marxism among Chinese. It was often contrasted with the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which granted Shandong to Japan.\nThe manifesto was prompted by the Bolshevik advance into Siberia, which created a need to establish a relationship with China. The Bolsheviks saw the Chinese as one of \"the oppressed peoples of the East\" and therefore a potential ally against the \"imperialist\" powers.\nThe manifesto is addressed to, \"the Chinese people and the Governments of North and South China.\" Because both Russia and China were in a state of civil war at this time, diplomatic exchanges were often delayed. Although the document was published in Moscow in August 1919, it was not formally presented to Chinese diplomats until February 1920. The version presented at this time includes the passage, \"the Soviet Government returns to the Chinese people, without any compensation, the Chinese Eastern Railway.\"\nSix months later, Karakhan personally handed the Chinese a second version of the manifesto, one that did not include this remarkable offer. In fact, the Soviet authorities denied ever having made it. The railway offer had been included by \"mistake,\" they explained. The Soviets may have hoped the offer of the railway would generate an enthusiastic response in Beijing, leading to a Sino-Soviet alliance against Japan. The warlords in Beijing, closely tied to Japan, responded hesitantly. When the hoped-for alliance proved unattainable, the Russians withdrew their offer. In any event, traditional Russian interests and rights in China, including control of the Chinese Eastern Railway, were reaffirmed in a series of secret agreements made in 1924–1925.\nThe manifesto came at a crucial time in the development of Chinese communism. It encouraged interest in Marxism and thus played a role in the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921.\n\n"}

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the present structure of the temple is believed to have been built during the Cholas period in the 10th century. The temple has received gracious endowments from the Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi. Shiva is worshipped as Kripapureeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Mangalambigai.\nThe presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the \"Tevaram\", written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as \"Paadal Petra Sthalam\". A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The temple is closely associated with Sundarar, the saivite saint of the 8th century, who started singing his \"Tirumurai\" starting with \"Pitha Piraisudi\" verse in this temple.\nThe temple is open from 6am - 11 am and 4-8:00 pm on all days except during festival days when it is open the full day. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Aadi star day celebrated during the Tamil month of \"Aaadi\" (June - July) for Sundarar and Panguni Uthiram festival during \"Panguni\" (March - April) with a float festival being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nLegend.\nAs per Hindu legend, the sages in Tharukavanam were very proud of their achievements and started doing a penance to destroy Shiva. Shiva absorbed all the evils from the penance and realising their mistake, the sages started their worship to Shiva. Shiva blessed them with their wishes and came to be known as Krupapureeswarar, the \"God who would bestow wishes of the devotees\". As per another legend, Sundarar, the famous Saivite saint and Nayanmar, was stopped by an old man from marrying at Thirukovilur. He showed a document indicating Sundarar was indebted to the old man for serving him for a lifetime. Sundarar called him \"Pitha\", a lunatic. The village elders after analysing the document, asked Sundarar to follow the old man. Sundarar followed the old mand and served him in his household. It was later revealed to him that Shiva appeared as the old man to test his servitude. Sundarar felt guilty of accusing Shiva, but Shiva revealed to him in a divine voice that he enjoyed the verse and requested him to sing verses starting with \"Pitha\".\nSundarar started singing his \"Tirumurai\" with \"Pitha Piraisudi\" verse in this temple and later would go on to become one of the four most venerated saints of Saiva literature.\nArchitecture.\nThe exact year of building could not be ascertained from the inscriptions, but the inscriptions found in the Visalur temple indicate benevolent gifts to the temple from Raja Raja Chola I (984-1015 CE) and his successors. Based on the inscriptions, researchers point out that the temple had gardens, which were supposed to have both floral plants and fruit bearing trees. The temple has received gracious endowments from the Chola queen Sembiyan Mahadevi and is believed to have established various sculptures.\nKripapureeswar temple is located in Thiruvennainallur, a village located from Villupuram on the Panruti- Thirukovilur road. The temple has a seven-tiered \"rajagopuram\", the gateway tower that pierces the rectangular wall that houses all the shrines. The sanctum houses the image of Kripapureeswarar in the form of Lingam, an iconic form of Shiva. There is an Ardha Mandap and a Mukha mandap, pillared halls leading to the sanctum. The first precinct has the images of Vinayakar, Murugan, Durga, Dakshinamurthy and Chandikeswara. The hall where the case was fought between the old man and Sundarar is believed to be the Panchyat Mandap located on the right side of the entrance.\nCulture.\nThe temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the \"pooja\" (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: \"Kalasanthi\" at 6:00 a.m., \"Uchikalam\" at 11:00 a.m., \"Sayarakshai\" at 5:00 p.m., and \"Sayarakshai\" between 7:45  - 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: \"alangaram\" (decoration), \"neivethanam\" (food offering) and \"deepa aradanai\" (waving of lamps) for both Kripapureeswarar and Mangalambigai. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6am - 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm.\nAadi star day celebrated during the Tamil month of \"Aaadi\" (June - July) as Sundarar's birthday and Panguni Uthiram festival during \"Panguni\" (March - April) with a float festival being the most prominent festivals. There are other common festivals like Shivaratri, Vinayaga Chaturthi, Vijayadasami and Karthigai Deepam celebrated in the temple.\nSundarar, an 8th-century Tamil \"Saivite\" poet, venerated Kripapureeswarar in ten verses in \"Tevaram\", compiled as the \"Seventh Tirumurai\". As the temple is revered in \"Tevaram\", it is classified as \"Paadal Petra Sthalam\", one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\n\n"}

It is issued on Government sanctioned Form No. 20 by the Shipping Master under the provisions of Sections 120-138 of Merchant Shipping Ordinance, 2001. It is issued under a standard operative procedure (SOP), generally SSB contains the minimum information as given below:\nOther pages of SSB contain columns for Seaman engagement and discharge record, promotion/advancement, company listing, summary of previous voyages, visa endorsement, official entries by the concerned issuing office etc. SSB is issued from National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) after following prescribed procedure and deposit of fee. The (SSB) is also liable to be cancelled, suspended or confiscated if a seaman is found to be involved in contravention of any local law.\nIn Pakistan one of the sources of getting SSB in the category of ship's ratings/crew is conduct of courses from private sector institutions which are commonly known as GP or GP-III courses.\nSSB Holders in the country.\nPrior to 1990 Pakistan government was practicing the policy for issuance of CDC (now SSB) only to a certain number per year in order to ensure the availability of job to each and every seamen holding CDC under roster system. Earlier, there was just one government-owned institute, namely Pakistan Marine Academy, however, after promulgation of Merchant Shipping Ordinance (2001) institutes in private sector have allowed to offer training to semen for issuance of SSB according to their qualification and out of 10 approved institutes, five are actively conducting their business of training and education in accordance with STCW Convention. This has increased number of SSB holders in Pakistan in access of demand. About 40% of Pakistani seafarers are jobless for a long time. However, Government Shipping Office discloses that there are about 8,000 officers and 10,500 ratings duly registered as seamen. Out of this total number of registered seamens about 30% are employed on national as well as foreign ships. The employment on foreign ships is about 85% of the total seamen engaged in this field.\nVisa on Passport to Pakistani SSB holder.\nAfter mishap of 9/11 most of the European and North American countries placed restrictions for Pakistani seafarers for carrying with them passport and SSB along with the visa of that country before they could leave the Pakistan to join the ship if it was berthed in any European or North American country.\n\n"}

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.\nDescription and history.\nThe dam is located in far western Guilford, upstream of the Green River Covered Bridge, which spans the Green River at the junction of Green River Road with Jacksonville Stage Road. The dam is about long, with a maximum height of , and spans the river in a semicircle open to the downstream side. The material of the dam mostly logs and rubble, with plank facing. The abutments of the dam are now a combination of stone and concrete, the wing wall on the east side extending downstream toward the bridge, where it formed part of the foundation of a now-destroyed mill.\nThe earliest recorded documentation of a dam on this site dates to 1811, when Jonah Cutting is known to have a paper and linseed oil mill operating at the site. Some of the materials of the present dam may well date to this period. By 1856 the mill is only documented as being used for paper production. In 1869 a major flood apparently damaged the mill beyond repair, and it may also have damaged the dam; it washed out the bridge then standing just downstream. In 1871 Henry Stowe erected a lumber and grist mill on the site, which operated until 1918, when it was destroyed by fire. The dam has since then been maintained by private owners, forming a picturesque part of the small Green River village and a reminder of its modest industrial past.\n\n"}

He studied at the faculty of Industrial Design in Florence where he attended a fine art and drawing course. In the early stage of his career, ALO's oil paintings focused on female portraiture and on the representation of human loss and defeat which will become the landmark subject of his \"losers\" series. After few months, ALO decided to continue his activity working as a self-taught artist. This formation period led him to define his current style based on linear intersections and strong chromatic contrasts. Four years later ALO went back to his native city, Perugia, for his very first solo exhibition \"The underdogs show\". Influenced by the street art world, ALO decided to reproduce his indoor techniques in the outdoor spaces and started travelling around Europe, in particular to Rome, Milan, Berlin and then to Paris and London, the cities that offered him the biggest \"open air canvas\". ALO is currently based in London, where he had his first major solo show \"Hail to the loser\" at Saatchi Gallery, with which he started a continuous collaboration.\nUrban Expressionism.\nFascinated by the French and German Expressionism of the beginning of the 20th century, ALO chose the oil painting as the medium of his early artistic production.\nSome of the aspects of his most recent pieces, such as the strong chromaticism and the stylized human figures, can be already seen in his very first body of work and they are inspired by the sharp, essential lines typical of the African art.\nALO's style became the more and more refined and the use of the acrylic paint in his works is now predominant. ALO's portraits are the result of his deep study of the human figure, they show the artist's personal ideal of beauty and elegance together with his ability to understand and represent the complexity of the female nature.\nInspired by a variety of artists, from Cezanne and Van Gogh to Kirchner and Picasso, ALO portrays people at the corners of the city streets, at the margins of society. His curious and open approach led him to the urban art world. ALO represents his emotional vision of the reality and transforms his characters into graceful figures full of elegance and solemnity.\nALO brings the classic portraiture genre to the urban outdoor setting, taking distance from the predominant pop influences of the street art style. His characters are framed by colorful backgrounds, an important element that defines the emotional energy of the artwork and strengthen the idea of \"street painting\".

It was active from 1870 to 1919.\nHistory.\nThe MWSA was founded in 1870 by suffrage activists Julia Ward Howe, Lucy Stone, Henry Browne Blackwell, and others. It was affiliated initially with the national American Woman Suffrage Association, which had been founded the previous year, and later became a chapter of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). One of its own affiliates was the Cambridge Political Equality Association.\nThe MWSA lobbied for women to get the vote and the right to be officials of civic organizations such as school boards, educated people about women's rights, organized public demonstrations such as rallies and parades, and coordinated with suffrage associations in other states. Among the people active in the MWSA were physician Martha Ripley, social activist Angelina Grimké, reformer Ednah Dow Littlehale Cheney, and suffragist Susan Walker Fitzgerald.\nIn 1892, the recent merger of several national suffrage associations and other factors prompted Alice Stone Blackwell and Ellen Battelle Dietrick to write a new constitution for the MWSA that would expand its capacities and funding base (e.g. by making it possible for the MWSA to receive bequests). The new MWSA was incorporated in December of that year. A decade later, in 1901, it merged with a smaller Massachusetts suffrage organization, the National Suffrage Association of Massachusetts. By 1915, the MWSA had over 58,000 members.\nBetween 1904 and 1915, the MWSA was headquartered at 6 Marlborough Street in Boston's Back Bay, afterwards the headquarters of the Women's Municipal League of Boston and then the home of physician Louis Agassiz Shaw, Jr.\nIn 1920, after the passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution gave women the vote, the MWSA became the Massachusetts League of Women Voters.\nRecords pertaining to the history of the MWSA are held by Radcliffe College's Schlesinger Library.\n\n"}

It also occurs in the southern region of Canada and in the northern region of Mexico. \"O. speciosa\" inhabits areas of tallgrass and mixed grass prairies, often preferring areas of shorter grass that are interspersed throughout the prairie plant matrix, including grasses that have been grazed upon by larger animals.\nAt the southern end of the range (e.g., in Texas), adult \"O. speciosa\" are most abundant during August to October, with fewer adults present from May to December. In the northern extent of its range (e.g., New England) adult \"O. speciosa\" are most abundant during the months of July and August.\nIdentification.\n\"Orphulella speciosa\" has a very slanted face. The margins of the vertex of the head (the top of the head, located between the eyes) are less raised. The foveola (a small dent in the integument) is not distinct. The pronotum disks are found at the top of the first thoracic segment and are almost equivalent in width in the front and back. The principal sulcus on the pronotum, which is a ridge that cuts the middle of the outer integument, cuts the pronotum disk a little past the middle. The tegmina (the leathery, slender forewings extend to the end of the hind femora, and curve in towards the apex. The males' hind femora often vary in size from 1.5 mm to 3mm from the end of the femora. \"O. speciosa\" are sexually dimorphic; the females are much larger than the males. Female body sizes range from 16-21.5 mm with antennae that are 5-6mm long, tegmina that are 9-16mm long, and hind femora that are 9.5–12 mm long. Males range from 13-14mm in total length with antennae 4.5-6.5mm in length, tegmina, 101–13 mm in length, and hind femora are 8.5–10 mm in length. On lower end of the lateral lobes (the vertical sides of the pronotum of the males, there is a pale curved line. \"O. speciosa\" individuals exhibit much variation in color, especially combinations of green and brown. Females are often light green with a dark coloration on the vertex of the head. Females are occasionally brown and have a line on the sides of the pronotum. \n\"O. speciosa\" looks very similar to a related species in the same genus, \"O. pelidna\". These two species can be identified from one another by looking at the fastigium (the part of the head that is located in between the eyes of the grasshoppers and their size. \"O.speciosa\" has a small median ridge on the fastigium and is much smaller than \"O. pelidna\". \"O. pelidna\" has a semicircular indentation that is set farther back than on \"O. speciosa\", and \"O. pelidna\" has a lateral carinae that is incised twice.\nNymphal development.\nLike all grasshoppers, nymphs of \"O. speciosa\" have incomplete metamorphosis: their nymphs are born looking similar to the adults, and they go through five instar stages (4 different molting events) until they reach the adult stage. First and second instars have patterns of green on their heads; however, the antennae are terminally expanded (they grow from the head outwards) . Second instars have antennae that are flat and are pointed at the end. The hind femora of the first and second instars appear tan and they have a green thorax. Instars II to V have filiform, or threadlike, antennae. Third and fourth instars have tan, brown, green, and gray body color patterns, and their hind femora appear fuscous (brownish-gray) .\n\n"}

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the present structure of the temple is believed to have been built during the Kongu Cholas period in the 10th century. Shiva is worshipped as Thirumuruganatheeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Avudainayagi.\nThe presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the \"Tevaram\", written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as \"Paadal Petra Sthalam\". A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple does not have a rajagopuram, the gateway tower, a common feature in South Indian temples.\nThe temple is open from 5:30 am – 12:45 pm and 3:30 - 8:15 pm on all days. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavam celebrated during the Tamil month of \"Maasi\" (February - March) for Sundarar and Mahashivaratri festival being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nLegend.\nSundarar is a famous Saivite saint and Nayanmar belonging to the 8th century. He has revered many Shiva temples in South India in his verses compiled as the Seventh \"Thirumurai\". As per Hindu legend, while arriving at this place, he took rest in a Vinayaka temple. He presumably forgot to get thoughts about Shiva and to test his devotion, Shiva sent his Bhutaganas to steal all his possessions. Sundarar prayed to Vinayaka in the temple who showed him to proceed towards the East. Sundarar, in his anger, sang about Shiva blaming him of not protecting his possessions. Shiva graced him with his presence at this place and restored all his possessions. Murugan killed the demon king Surapadma at the behest of the Devas. He incurred Brahmahatti Dosha for slaying the demon into two pieces. Muruga is believed to have dug a spring with his Vel, the spear and worshipped Shiva at this place. Since Muruga worshipped his father Shiva, the presiding deity came to be known as Muruganathaswamy.\nArchitecture.\nThe temple is believed to have been built by the Kongu Cholars, with 68 recorded inscriptions from the king Vikrama Chola I seen on the walls of the sanctum and around the precinct. \nThirumuruganatheeswarar temple is located in Thirumuruganpoondi, a village located from Tiruppur on the Tiruppur- Avinasi road. The temple does not have \"rajagopuram\" as in other South Indian temples. All the shrines are housed in a rectangular enclosure measuring . The sanctum houses the image of Thirumuruganatheeswarar in the form of Lingam, an iconic form of Shiva facing West. There is an Ardha Mandap and a Mukha mandap, pillared halls leading to the sanctum. There is a shrine of Muruga facing South, towards the Shiva shrine. Since Muruga is believed to have used his weapon, the Vel, to dig the spring, he is seen without his weapon in the shrine, nor his vehicle peacock. The first precinct has the images of Vinayakar, Durga, Dakshinamurthy and Chandikeswara. The shrine of Avudainayagi is seen in the first precinct facing west. There are sculptural depictions of Sundarar on the walls showing him in three different emotions of anger, humiliation and happiness. There is a hall of Nataraja called Adavallan Sabha. There are three temple tanks associated with the temple - Shanmugha Theertham, Gnana Theertham and Brahmatheertham. There are images of Kalabhairavar and Lingothbhavar, which are considered architectural specimens of the Kongu Cholars.\nCulture.\nThe temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the \"pooja\" (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: \"Ushakalam\" at 6:00 a.m., \"Kalasanthi\" at 8:00 a.m., \"Uchikalam\" at 12:00 p.m., and \"Sayaratchai\" at 5:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: \"alangaram\" (decoration), \"neivethanam\" (food offering) and \"deepa aradanai\" (waving of lamps) for both Thirumuruganatheeswarar and Avudainayagi. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 5:30 am – 12:45 pm and 3:30 - 8:15 pm.\nBrahmotsavam celebrated during the Tamil month of \"Maasi\" (February - March) for Sundarar and Mahashivaratri festival being the most prominent. There are other common festivals like Thaipoosam, Annabhishekam, Kanthasashti and Karthigai Deepam celebrated in the temple.\nSundarar, an 8th-century Tamil \"Saivite\" poet, venerated Thirumuruganatheeswarar in ten verses in \"Tevaram\", compiled as the \"Seventh Tirumurai\". As the temple is revered in \"Tevaram\", it is classified as \"Paadal Petra Sthalam\", one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. Out of the 276 temples that are revered by the three saints, Sundarar has exclusively visited 25 temples with this temple counting as one of them. Of the five thandavams performed by Shiva in different places, this place is counted as the one where he performed the Brahma Thandavam In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\n\n"}

In the late Ming and Qing dynasties, it was a standard text read by the daughters of aristocratic families. The four books had circulated separately and were combined by the publishing house Duowen Tang in 1624.\nThe four books are \"Admonitions for Women\" (\"Nǚjiè\") by Ban Zhao, \"Women's Analects\" (\"Nǚ lúnyǔ\") by Song Ruoxin and Song Ruozhou, \"Domestic Lessons\" (\"Nèixùn\") by Empress Xu, and \"Sketch of a Model for Women\" (\"Nüfan jielu\") by Lady Liu.\nIn \"Admonitions\", Ban Zhou, China's foremost female scholar, expounds on general principles and philosophical points. In \"Women's Analects\", the Songs illustrate these principles with practical examples relevant to everyday life.\nIn \"Model for Women\", Lady Liu retells the inspiring tales of various women in Chinese history. There are example of every kind of famous women from every period. Aside from Ban Zhao, there is also Liang Hongyu, who beat war drums in battle to encourage her husband, a Song dynasty general. Scholarship and sacrifice for nation and family are extolled.\nBan Zhao's book was the most widely read of the four. She wrote that a woman should practice \"reverent submission\", respect for the three obediences and four virtues, and \"set her husband on a par with Heaven.\" Ban Zhao compared marriage to the Dao, with the husband as the yin and the wife as the yang. This is a more romantic view of marriage than anything found in Confucius.\nBan Zhao's life story was more inspiring than her writing. She was a Han dynasty scholar who not only tutored an empress, but also completed an official history begun by her brother. Reformers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries often cited her to make the case for female education.\nThe Four Books explicitly argues for such education. \"There were no wise and chaste women who were not created through education,\" as \"Domestic Lessons\" puts it. Regardless of content, the Four Books were designed to teach women to read, a controversial and progressive idea at the time. All four books were written by accomplished women, a point many editions underline by including biographical sketches and drawings of the authors in scholarly regalia.\nThe \"four books\" of the title alludes to the four books of Neo-Confucianism compiled by Zhu Xi.

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48691102","title":"Ambitalk","body":"\nAmbitalk\n\nAmbitalk is the UK's largest PAMR radio network. It allows users to make private or \"group\" voice calls between vehicle based mobile units anywhere within its coverage area. It is a Trunked radio system operating in the VHF-Low frequency range and provides coverage in most of the main conurbations of the UK.\nAmbitalk is owned by Maxxwave Ltd and operates using MPT1327 signalling with custom audio enhancements using Digital Signal Processing to give clearer audio quality than is normally available from MPT1327 or DMR/dPMR (which use the AMBE+2 codec).\nThe UK Government has commissioned a UK Spectrum Usage and Demand report through the UK Spectrum Policy Forum (run by Department for Culture, Media and Sport). This report looks at all major communications solutions available across the UK and recognises that a significant number of two way radio users in the UK are now using Ambitalk as their preferred communications platform.\nFurthermore Ambitalk was awarded in 2015 the FCS Gerald David OBE award for Innovation in Business Radio. This award is given by the FCS, the UK communications trade body for the innovation that has been demonstrated by Ambitalk which sets it apart from other PAMR solutions.\nHistory.\nThe concept of Public Access radio networks is not new, with many networks such as GEC National One and Band Three Radio being launched in the UK in the 1980s. These closed around 2003 when Dolphin Telecom entered administration for the final time.\nThroughout the period of the 1980s to 2003 there had always existed smaller \"regional\" radio networks within the UK, with several of the larger networks operating a number of interconnected \"regional\" networks that formed a quasi-National operation. Wavelength and Fleetcomm, both now defunct are examples of these.\nAmbitalk is a reincarnation of the Maxxwave regional network originally covering Rugby, Coventry and Warwick in the Midlands and later adding additional transmitter stations to cover areas of London and Birmingham.\nAround 2013 this regional radio network, previously powered by Zetron and Fylde MPT1327 controllers on Band III was redeveloped, with custom controllers designed by Maxxwave and was redeployed to lower frequency bands. This gave considerable cost savings, allowing the network to rapidly expand.\nCurrent state.\nFrom 2013 onwards Ambitalk rapidly expanded, obtaining low cost national spectrum (due to the unpopular low frequency bands) and installing additional transmitter sites around the country.\nIn 2015 Ambitalk has concentrated on resilience and reliability, having replaced all Landline connections between transmitter sites with private Microwave and in-band links, giving it complete independence in case of any major catastrophe.\nAmbitalk therefore is the only publicly accessible resilient wireless two-way communications network in the UK with other networks such as Airwave Solutions being closed, only available to select user groups. Furthermore it has a considerable amount of spare capacity, made available through its low frequency operation (rather than operating in congested UHF spectrum like Airwave) so therefore is far less likely to suffer congestion issues in case of major incidents.\nIt has now become a clear market leader, having been awarded the prestigious Gerald David OBE Award in Innovation by the FCS (Federation of Communications Specialists), in recognition of the advancements it has made in the Two way radio arena. It is mentioned by name in numerous Ofcom documents with respect to the huge advances made in spectrum efficiency.\nLow frequency bands.\nAmbitalk is unique not only because it is the UK's largest PAMR network but because it reverses the trend for modern wireless deployments to migrate to higher frequency bands.\nHigher frequency bands are preferred for rolling out wireless communications systems due to the lack of interference from atmospheric disturbances, smaller antennas and more manageable coverage characteristics, vital when planning a Cellular network\nLow frequencies on the other hand are traditionally plagued by electronic interference from numerous sources and are prone to being unusable for weeks on end during summer months due to interference from foreign transmitters due to Sporadic E propagation thereby giving poor quality signals.\nAmbitalk has counteracted this Sporadic E interference by developing a Smart antenna array for low frequency bands. Such systems are normally only deployed in far higher frequency bands and the use of such a system in a low frequency band is somewhat unusual. However with these arrays it is possible to virtually eliminate interference from continental sources, thereby giving high availability of a level equal to or better than that possible with higher frequency bands.\nAt a time when frequency spectrum is becoming increasingly scarce, with many of the traditional Business Radio frequency bands within the UK now being completely congested preventing any new two way radio deployments being made, the migration of users to these lower frequency bands is welcomed by the UK regulators such as Ofcom.\nSee also.\nAmbitalk website: \n\n"}

He attended evening classes at the Royal Provincial Vocational School in Elberfeld, where he received his first lessons in drawing and painting.\nHe spent the years 1874 and 1877 studying in Bad Kreuznach, in the sculpture workshop of the brothers Robert and Karl Cauer. He then further developed his craft in 1878 under Melchior zur Strassen in the Leipzig Academy of Visual Arts and until 1880 in the Academy of Arts, Berlin with Otto Knille and Fritz Schaper. In 1885, he won the Rome Scholarship from the Prussian Academy of Arts for his thesis, \"The Judgment of Paris\".\nIn subsequent years, Neumann-Torborg lived and worked in Rome, where his wife, Emma Commichau, died after a short marriage. In 1892, the artist returned to Berlin. In 1917, he fell seriously ill and died during a visit to his hometown of Elberfeld. His tomb is located in the Lutheran cemetery in Wuppertal-Elberfeld.\nWorks.\nMany of Neumann-Torborgs works were destroyed during the Second World War.\nPerhaps his best-known work, the fountain \"Faun and Nymph\", was commissioned by Baron August von der Heydt and originally stood in the park of his estate. It survived the Second World War unscathed and since 1909 has been on display in Bad Godesberg, Bonn. In 2013, it was restored and moved to a new location to permit greater public access.\nAnother relief of Neuman-Torborg's, showing dancing youths with Bacchus, was installed in the Bad Godesberg city park in 2014. The sculpture includes a bench and a bust of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus, and was recovered in pieces from the van der Heydt estate.\nThe \"Elberfeld Poor Relief Monument\" was destroyed during the war, when the bronze figures were melted down for metal. In 2003, the granite pedestal of the monument was rediscovered during excavations at the Elberfeld Old Reformed Church, and placed on display in Blankstrasse, Wuppertal. In 2011, it was restored thanks to 24 private donations. The bronze figures were recast at the Kayser Art Foundry in Düsseldorf.

Therefore, together with the Swiss doctor Giuseppe Maggi (1910-1988) he founded the hospitals of Tokombéré (1962), Zina (1970) and Mada (1978).In the latter, a heath reference center, he worked driving patients in a jeep-ambulance for many years, a job which enabled him to get to know the territory and, mainly, to be close to the 250,000 inhabitants living in the surroundings of the hospital, a vast area of about 200 kilometres including four countries: Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.\nIn 1988 when doctor Maggi died, Jordi Mas went on to school founding, as it was evident for him that people without education have neither hope nor future.

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48691795","title":"Anita Krajnc case","body":"\nAnita Krajnc case\n\nThe Anita Krajnc case refers to the case of Toronto resident Anita Krajnc who has been charged with criminal mischief for giving water to pigs in a slaughter truck on the way to Fearman's Pork Inc. slaughterhouse, located in Burlington, Greater Toronto Area. This incident occurred on June 22, 2015.\nBackground.\nAnita Krajnc is co-founder of Toronto Pig Save, which was started in 2010. A \"Huffington Post Canada\" story titled \"Meet The Compassionate Canadians Who Give It All To Animals\" includes Krajnc as one of the five chosen and describes her as having \"a mighty heart to bear witness to any creature's grim odyssey to death\" for \"she has been standing \"vigil\" at the gates of death for thousands of pigs\".\nKrajnc holds a PhD in Political Science from the University of Toronto. Her doctoral thesis was based on the role of scientific knowledge and public education in building international environmental regimes. Krajnc has been Assistant Professor at Queen's University. She has also been a media democracy activist and a writer. She was an aide to Charles Caccia former Minister of Environment and Climate Change.\nIncident.\nThe related incident occurred on June 22, 2015, outside Fearman's Pork Inc. slaughter house in Burlington. The protest was undertaken by Toronto Pig Save, a group to which Krajnc, who is described as an animal rights activist, belongs. Krajnc and her group were providing water to pigs in trucks carrying them to slaughter, as they stopped at a traffic island at the intersection of Appleby Line and Harvester Road, through the vents on the sides of the truck. As they were doing so, a driver of one of the trucks, Jeffrey Veldjesgraaf, got down and went to her and asked her to stop. Krajnc recited a verse from the biblical Book of Proverbs: \"If they are thirsty, give them water\". In response Veldjesgraaf called her \"a dumb fricking broad\" and told her that the pigs weren't human. Krajnc asked Veldjesgraaf to be compassionate, Veldjesgraaf said he would call the police, Krajnc suggested that she would call Jesus. Veldjesgraaf asked what she was feeding the pigs, Krajnc said that it was water, he told her that he wanted proof, Krajnc suggested that he trust her and offered him a sample. Veldjesgraaf asked her to desist from feeding again. Krajnc said that if the pigs were thirsty they would be fed again. Veldjesgraaf threatened to knock the bottle off, Krajnc retorted that she would charge him with assault. The driver then walked off, boarded the truck and drove on. This interaction was filmed by Krajnc's associates. On June 23, 2015, Eric van Boekel, from whose farm the pigs were brought, filed a case against Krajnc. On September 9, 2015, Krajnc was charged with criminal mischief, the penalty for which ranges from a fine to 10 years in prison. In response, the group arranged a vigil on September 24. On October 14, 2015, Krajnc appeared in court for an arraignment, to have charges read to her. In the context of the case \"The Daily Telegraph\" reports that under Canadian law pigs are considered property and can be transported without food and water for 36 hours. Krajnc has said that she would refuse to pay any fine and that she was willing to suffer imprisonment.\nVeldjesgraaf stated that the activists were entitled to protest, his objection was to their touching his truck (which may jeopardise their own safety) or feeding the pigs. He considers the charges justifiable. He claims that the pigs were loaded an hour before the incident and it was unlikely they were dehydrated. \"Metro\" printed a rebuttal from Bob Comis, a former breeder who stated that the pigs as seen in video of the incident showed symptoms of \"severe heat stress\". Eric van Boekel in support of his complaint said, \"They don't have the right to involve other people's property and they don’t have the right to protest illegally\". He claimed that rules set by pig breeders regarding food and water were followed by his operations. A story reporting the incident noted that breeding facilities owned by the same Eric van Boekel were charged with polluting the Thames river in April 2007 and fined $120,000.\nKrajnc has stated that treating living animals such as pigs as property – \"no different than a toaster\" – is the focal issue of the matter and that being compassionate to others should not be considered criminal.\nReactions.\n\"The Guardian\" reports that many online petitions have been created in defence of Krajnc. By November 30, 2015, the petition on Care2 called \"Compassion Isn't a Crime\" had 125,500 signatories, while another on Change.org asking the Ontario Court of Justice to drop charges against her, had over 24,600. \"The Daily Telegraph\" considers the case \"a cause célèbre for animal welfare activists\". Another story reports that the case has caused Krajnc to \"become a minor celebrity on social media.\" Instagram and Facebook pages have been created.\n\n"}

Various temples in Rajasthan and elsewhere are devoted to her worship and to commemorate her act. Rani Sati Temple Jhunjhunu is biggest temple of Rani Sati in india.\nJai Shree Rani Sati\nHistory.\nThe history of\nRani Sati Dadi Maa starts from the time of Mahabharata.\nNarayani's wish of being married to Abhimanyu and her desire to be sati in her next life.\nAs granted by Lord Krishna, in her next life she was born as the daughter of Gursamal in the village of Dokwa in Rajasthan. She was named - Narayani. Abhimanyu took birth in Hissar as son of Jaliram and named - Tandhan. Tandan and Narayani got married and were leading a peaceful life. He was in possession of a beautiful horse which was being eyed by the son of king of Hissar from quite some time. Tandan refused to hand over his precious horse to the king’s son.\nThe king’s son then decides to forcefully acquire the horse and thus challenges Tandan for a combat. However Tandan fights the battle bravely and kills the King’s son instead. The enraged king thus kills Tandan in front of Narayani in the battle. Narayani symbolic to female bravery and power fights with the king and kills him. She then commanded Ranaji (the caretaker of the horse) to make immediate arrangements for her to be set ablaze along with her husband’s cremation.\nRanaji playing a vital role in fulfilling her wish to be sati with her husband is then blessed by Narayani that his name will be taken and worshiped along with her name and since then she is known as Rani Sati.\nTemple.\nThe most amazing feature of this famous temple is that it does not hold any paintings or statues of either female or male gods. Instead a trident depicting power and force is worshipped religiously by the followers. However one can surely find a beautiful portrait of Rani Sati in the pradhan mand. The temple is prepared with white marbles and has colorful wall paintings.\nIn the complex of Rani Sati temple there is also the Lord Hanuman Temple, Sita Temple, Lord Ganesha Temple and Lord Shiva Temple. The regular ‘Prasad’ distribution takes place after every ‘aarti’. There are also arrangements made for the meals in day time on payment basis. It is beautiful and intricately crafted, not to forget the golden pot at the top of the temple.\nThere are in all 13 sati temples in the complex with 12 smaller one’s and 1 main temple dedicated to Rani Sati Dadi Built in pure white marble with a red fluttering flag at the top, the building forms are interesting and marvelous.\nA huge statue of Lord Shiva in the center of the complex surrounded by the lush green gardens, adds to the beauty of the place.\n Inside the temple, the interiors, adorned with exquisite murals and fascinating rich glass mosaics depicting the entire history of the place, are eye-catching.\nObservances and festivals.\nHundreds of devotees visit the temple every day. An elaborate aarti is performed at the temple two times a day. These are:\nA special Poojan utsav is held on the occasion of\n Bhadrapada Amavasya : The 15th day of the dark half of Bhadrapada month in the Hindu calendar is of special significance to the temple.\n\n"}

Little River joins Big River a few miles downstream to form the Coast Fork Willamette River.\nOn older maps, Little River appears as a tributary of Garoutte Creek, also known as Saroutte Creek. However, in 1988 the United States Board on Geographic Names renamed the lower reach of Garoutte Creek so that it became part of Little River.

He was an ex-husband of Jiang Qing, who later married Mao Zedong, and the father of Yu Qiangsheng, a top Chinese intelligence officer who defected to the United States in 1985, and Yu Zhengsheng, the fourth-ranked member of the Politburo Standing Committee.\nEarly life and revolution.\nYu Qiwei was born in 1912 to a prominent family in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province. His uncle Yu Ta-wei later served as Minister of National Defense of the Republic of China on Taiwan. The chemist Zeng Zhaolun was also his uncle. Yu enrolled in Shandong University in Qingdao, majoring in physics. At the same time, he spent significant amount of time in underground political activism for the Communist Party of China.\nWhile in Qingdao, Huang Jing met and married Li Yunhe (who would later change her name to \"Jiang Qing\" and marry Mao Zedong), in 1932. Huang introduced the 19-year-old Li to join the Communist Party in 1933. Soon afterwards, Huang was arrested by the government for his Communist activism. To avoid implicating Li, he sent a message asking her to leave him. Li was introduced to Shanghai film director Shi Dongshan, who was in Qingdao at the time, and followed Shi to Shanghai. After Huang's release in 1934, he lived with Li for a while with his family in Shanghai. However, Huang's family was adamantly against their marriage, and they became separated.\nIn 1935, Huang Jing, then attending Peking University, co-led the December 9th Movement with Yao Yilin and Huang Hua, demanding the Chinese government to actively resist Japanese aggression in the aftermath of the Mukden Incident.\nAfter the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Huang moved to the Communist base in Yan'an in winter 1939. Li Yunhe, now known as Jiang Qing, had also moved to Yan'an and married the Communist leader Mao Zedong. Huang later became a department head in the Communist bases in Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei (Jin-Cha-Ji) and Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan (Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu) border areas.\nPolitical career.\nFollowing the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Communists took over northern Hebei Province, and Huang was appointed Mayor of Zhangjiakou. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he became the Mayor of the Tianjin municipality, as well as the city's Communist Party Chief.\nIn 1952, Huang was appointed Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, which was in charge of the civilian industry (the Second Ministry was in charge of military work). When the National Technological Commission was established in 1956, he became its first chairman. While serving in these capacities Huang praised the work of a young engineer in Shanghai named Jiang Zemin, the later Chinese president, who recalled that Huang invited him to a banquet at the Quanjude duck restaurant, and on another occasion, talked to him for four hours until 11 pm.\nHuang Jing was considered a promising young star of the Communist Party, but was labelled a counterrevolutionary when the Anti-Rightist Campaign began in 1958. He died in Guangzhou that same year, at the age of only 46. The circumstances surrounding his death are unclear. It is said that he suffered from mental and physical diseases and died of heart disease in a military hospital.\nFamily.\nAfter his relationship with Jiang Qing ended, Huang Jing married the journalist Fan Jin, who later became vice mayor of Beijing and president of \"Beijing Daily\". Their son, Yu Qiangsheng, was a top Chinese intelligence officer who defected to the United States in 1985. Another son, Yu Zhengsheng, rose to become one of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee in 2012, which effectively rules China.\n\n"}

Incumbent president Heinz Fischer has served two terms and is not eligible to be elected for a third successive term.\nCandidates.\nSPÖ: The most likely candidate of the Social Democratic Party was considered to be Labour Minister Rudolf Hundstorfer, though First President of the National Council Doris Bures, Franz Vranitzky (former Chancellor of Austria from 1986 to 1997) and former undersecretary for EU affairs and businesswoman Brigitte Ederer were also mentioned. On 15 January 2016, Rudolf Hundstorfer was officially announced as the SPÖ's candidate.\nÖVP: Justice Minister Wolfgang Brandstetter (considered a possible, if unlikely ÖVP candidate) declined to stand on 26 December 2015. On 7 January 2016, ÖVP leader Reinhold Mitterlehner announced that Erwin Pröll, the Landeshauptmann of Lower Austria, would not be running, to much surprise (as many had predicted he was almost certainly going to be the ÖVP's candidate). Josef Pühringer, Landeshauptmann of Upper Austria, who had also occasionally been mentioned as an (unlikely) candidate, explicitly declined to stand on 8 January 2016. Franz Fischler (former Austrian European Commissioner from 1995 to 2004) and Othmar Karas (highly respected Member of the European Parliament) also both stated they were not the ÖVP candidate on 8 January 2016, while Wirtschaftskammerpräsident Christoph Leitl only said he would not comment before the official announcement by the party leadership on 10 January 2016. Even controversial former chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel (from 2000 to 2007) was briefly considered as a candidate (but he also declined). On 10 January 2016, former first president of the National Council Andreas Khol was officially announced as the ÖVP's candidate.\nOther names mentioned were former Science Minister and university professor Karlheinz Töchterle, Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz (who was too young too stand, not yet being 35 years old), former Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik (who was in office from 2004 to 2008, and most recently Austria's ambassador to France, about to be reassigned to Switzerland), former Raiffeisen Zentralbank manager Christian Konrad (currently the government's point man on refugee issues; he stated he was not a candidate on 8 January 2016), former Landeshauptfrau of Styria Waltraud Klasnic (in office from 1996 to 2005) and president of the Salzburg Festival Helga Rabl-Stadler, both of whom were considered unlikely to run. This left Plassnik and Leitl as possible candidates as of 8 January 2016. Later in the day, rumours indicated that former first president of the National Council Andreas Khol would be the ÖVP's candidate.\nFPÖ: Norbert Hofer (third president of the National Council), who had been considered the most likely FPÖ candidate, said on 28 December 2015 that he considered himself too young for the office and that he would prefer his party to pick someone else as its candidate. Possible candidates include president of the Austrian Court of Audit Josef Moser, Ursula Stenzel (former district mayor of Vienna's 1st District from 2005 to 2015 and also former Member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2006, both for the ÖVP), ombudsman Peter Fichtenbauer and possibly party leader Heinz-Christian Strache himself. Former Social Affairs Minister Ursula Haubner was considered a very unlikely candidate. As of 11 January 2016, Fichtenbauer, Moser and Stenzel continued to be the most likely candidates. Strache announced on 13 January 2016 that he would not be running himself, and that it was still open whether the FPÖ would nominate anyone at all. In mid-January, Vienna vice-mayor Johann Gudenus and former FPÖ leader and former vice-chancellor (from 1983 to 1987) Norbert Steger were also mentioned as possible candidates. On 19 January 2016, author and Middle East/migration pundit Karin Kneissl (well-known for her right-wing views) was mentioned as being recruited by the FPÖ to run, which she quickly declined. Former Justice Minister Dieter Böhmdorfer, members of parliament Harald Stefan and Johannes Hübner and MEP Barbara Kappel were also mentioned as possible candidates. On 20 January 2016, media reported that Gudenus had been internally selected as the FPÖ's candidate; on 26 January 2016, reports claimed Stenzel would be announced on 28 January 2016 as the FPÖ's candidate. Amid strong FPÖ-internal dissent, there were rumours the party leadership had been forced to reconsider, and that Hofer was now the most likely option, after all, with Gudenus also still in play. Commentators opined that the backtracking was a notable defeat for Strache. Norbert Hofer was announced as the FPÖ's candidate on 28 January 2016.\nGreens: In early January 2016, it was announced that former Greens party leader Alexander Van der Bellen would not be running as the Greens' “official” candidate, as that would have required a party convention decision; this was also framed as an attempt to put personality above party politics in the election. Van der Bellen officially announced his candidacy on 8 January 2016 in a YouTube video. NEOS leader Strolz stated that they would consider giving him the same support as Griss, depending on the same kind of hearing she went through.\nTeam Stronach: As of 22 January 2016, the Team Stronach was still considering whether to nominate a candidate.\nOthers: Independent candidate Irmgard Griss, a former Supreme Court of Justice judge and its president, officially declared her candidacy on 17 December 2015. She presented her candidacy to both the Freedom Party of Austria and NEOS, but both declined to endorse her. NEOS said they would support Griss and any other independent candidates indirectly, and voiced their concerns over the strong partisan politicization of the presidential office and the election campaign.\nRichard Lugner, society figure, businessman and previously candidate for president in 1998, was reportedly also considering running once more. Martin Wabl, who had previously attempted to run in 1998, 2004 and 2010, but failed to gather the necessary number of signatures of support, stated he would try to run once again. Ulrich Habsburg-Lothringen, whose initiative to get the so-called “Habsburger-Paragraf” (which had precluded members of the former ruling house from running for president) proved successful in 2011, stated he would like to run for president, but only if a political party decided to support him. Adrien Jean-Pierre Luxemburg-Wellenstein announced on 8 December 2015 he would run for president. Author El Awadalla (also known for winning the Austrian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?) announced her run on 12 January 2016. (She had previously run for the left-wing alliance Wien anders in the 2015 Viennese state election.) Local activist Franz Stieger (known in Krems for his numerous conflicts with local officials and government agencies) announced his candidacy on 13 January 2016. Further independent candidates who announced their runs were Gustav Jobstmann, Thomas Unden (a general practitioner who had stated he would refuse to treat asylum seekers), Gernot Pointner, Alois Merz, Georg Zakrajsek of the \"Interessengemeinschaft Liberales Waffenrecht Österreich\" (a fringe gun rights group), Karin Kolland, Robert Marschall of the EU Exit Party and Thomas Reitmayer of the Austrian version of the satirical political party Die PARTEI.\n\n"}

In 1863, his father was exiled to Siberia for his participation in the January Uprising. His mother followed with the family, as far as she could, and he grew up in the Urals. His first lessons in art were given to him there by Lucjan Kraszewski (brother of the writer Józef Ignacy Kraszewski), who was also living in exile.\nIn 1874, his father was pardoned, but they were not allowed to return to their old home, so they settled in Warsaw, where he studied painting with Wojciech Gerson. His work there attracted the attention of Henryk Siemiradzki who, in 1880, helped him gain admission to the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg. He graduated in 1885, earning a silver medal and the official title of \"Artist\" for his canvas \"Transport of the Wounded\". In 1889, he spent some time in Munich, improving his skills with Alfred Kowalski.\nIn 1900, he won another silver medal at the Exposition Universelle. As a result, from 1903 to 1904 he lived in Paris, then settled on his parent's estate near Pukhavichy, in what is now Belarus. During the First World War, he was forced to return to Warsaw and remained there until his death.\nAn avid hunter, many of his landscapes included animal life. In addition to his painting, he illustrated several works, notably two by his cousin, Józef Weyssenhoff; \"Erotyki\" (1911), a book of poetry, and \"Soból i Panna\" (1913), a novel that is loosely based on the manorial lifestyle of the Weyssenhoff family.\n\n"}

He was described by one historian as \"a flamboyant Birmingham mogul and New South industrialist.\"\nHailing from east Tennessee, in his early working years, Swann was a power salesman for the Alabama Power Company.\nHe established the Federal Phosphorus Company to produce concentrated phosphoric acid, mainly for use as a concentrated fertilizer, using a novel method to produce the acid from phosphate rock by heat treatment in an electric furnace.\nHe later established the Swann Chemical Company, focused on production of PCBs for the emergent electrical industry. Swann Chemical Company operated a chemical manufacturing plant in Anniston, Alabama where PCBs were first made on an industrial scale after development of a new process under Swann's leadership. In 1920, Swann gave his engineers the challenge of creating a process by which PCBs, up to that time very expensive and produced only in small quantities, could be produced in industrial quantities, and after much trial and error, they succeeded. The plant was later bought by Monsanto Industrial Chemicals Co. in 1935. The plant, just west of Anniston, had around 1,000 employees. One historian wrote that, \"In many ways, the spirit of Swann Chemical became the corporate culture of Monsanto.\"\nSwann's house in Birmingham, Alabama, built from 1927 to 1930, was at the time the largest residence in the city and cost $600,000 to build.\nWhile Monsanto became the most successful agrochemical corporation in the world, Swann began to slide into poverty. He was forced to sell his castle in 1945 when he filed for bankruptcy. He nearly made a comeback by selling a new design for a furnace to process iron ore to the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, but the dictator reneged after paying only a modest down payment.

The story is 80 pages long.\nSynopsis.\nA little boy named Andy was so interested about lions that he went to the library and searched for a book about lions. That same night, his grandfather told him a bedtime story about lions. Andy was so fascinated about the story that he had a dream about lions that same night. The next day, on his way to school, Andy meets a real lion. The lion had a thorn stuck in his paw and Andy helps pull the thorn out. This action makes Andy and the lion friends. Later in the story, a circus comes to Andy's town and of course, Andy attends hoping to see his friend the lion. In the lion act, one of the lions jumps out of the cage, into the audience, right in front of Andy. Andy thinks it's his last day of life. But low and behold, it was his friend the lion! Andy and the lion recognize one another. The lion was the very same one Andy had helped that day take the thorn out of his paw. Andy and the lion rejoice in excitement of seeing one another again. When the crowd attempts to capture the lion, Andy protects it. The next day, there is a parade and Andy and the lion lead it. Andy receives an award for bravery. At the end of the story, Andy returns the book he borrowed from the library about lions, pulling his friend the lion behind him.\n\n"}

He worked in Brazil as a captive, however he escaped and fled to New York in 1847, assuring his freedom. He wrote a biography, published by American abolitionist Samuel Moore in 1854. His report is the only known document about slave trade written by a Brazilian former slave.\nBiography.\nBaquaqua was born in Djougou (current in Benin) between 1820 and 1830, in a proeminent Muslim trader family. He learned the Quran, literature and mathematics in an Islamic school. Still as an adolescent, he took part into the succession wars in Daboya, together with his brother, where he was captured and then rescued.\nBack to Djougou he became servant of a local dignitary, perhaps the chief of Soubroukou, to whom he calls 'king'. The abuses he committed on that period made him target of an ambush, where he was imprisoned and transported to Dahomey; he would be embarked into a slave ship in 1845 and taken to Pernambuco, in Brazil.\nBaquaqua was a slave in Olinda, Pernambuco around two years. His master was a baker, He worked in construction of houses, carrying stones, learned Portuguese and performed as “\"escravo de tabuleiro\"” (peddling slave). The cruelty of his Brazilian masters made him revert to alcoholism and to attempt suicide.\nTaken to Rio de Janeiro, Baquaqua was incorporated to the crew of the trade ship \"Lembrança\", transporting goods to the southern provinces of Brazil. A coffee shipment to the United States, in 1847, was his passport to freedom. The ship arrived to New York harbor in June, where it was approached by local abolitionists, who encouraged him to escape from the ship. After the escape, however, he was imprisoned in the local jail, and only the help of the abolitionists (that facilitated his escape from prison) prevented he was returned to the ship. It was then sent to Haiti, where he lived with the reverend Judd, a Baptist missionary.\nConverted and baptized in 1848 Baquaqua returned to the US due to the political instability Haiti was then; He studied at the New York Central College in McGrawville for almost three years. In 1854 he moved to Canada and his bibliography was published the same year by Samuel Downing Moore in Detroit.\nIt not known what happened to Baquaqua after 1857. He was then in England and had turned to the American Baptist Free Mission Society to be sent as a missionary to Africa.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48692563","title":"Elverskud","body":"\nElverskud\n\nElverskud is a ballad for soloist, choir and orchestra by Niels W. Gade from 1854.\nGade's oeuvre contains many concert pieces of various lengths for orchestra, choir and soloists. Depending on which one counts, there are up to 16 of them, mostly referred to as \"cantata\". The longest of the pieces can take up to an hour. Some of the pieces are almost semi-operas or concert operas with dramatic development.\nOrigins.\nThe plot of the song comes from the Danish folk-ballad \"Elveskud\".\nIn 1842 Gade wrote \"Agnete og Havfruerne\" for solo, female choir and orchestra with text by Hans Christian Andersen, and the same Andersen had in 1846 premiered the opera \"Liden Kirsten\" with music by Gade's father-in-law J. P. E. Hartmann. Both were inspired by Danish folksongs. This may have encouraged Gade to try his hand at the same set of motifs with a major concert piece.\nThe earliest information on \"Elverskud\" is a mention in a letter from Gade in 1849, in which he wrote that he had allowed Hans Christian Andersen to prepare a text. For whatever reason it was never used by Gade, but a draft can be found among Andersen's papers. Some parts of the text were transferred to the final version. The next person who turned his hand to this text was Christian Molbech in whose papers there is a version that is closer to the final one, which by all accounts was developed by Gade's cousin Carl Andersen and the editor Gottlieb Siesby, while the atmospheric choral interlude \"I østen stiger solen op\" was written already in 1837 by B. S. Ingemann and received a tune by C. E. F. Weyse the same year.\nThe first sheet of Gade's score is dated December 12, 1851, but in March 1853 the work is mentioned a letter to Gade from his wife, suggesting that he had no time to work on it. In early 1854 the work was published in a piano arrangement by a German publisher as \"Ballade nach dänischen Volkssagen\". On 30 March 1854, it was first performed at a subscription concert at the Musikforeningen, presented as a ballad for soloist, choir and orchestra.\nPlot summary.\nThe ballad is divided into five sections, a prologue, three \"acts\" and an epilogue.\nThe music.\nGade was apparently keen to emphasize that the music was not adaptations of folk songs, but rather all his own, but inspired by the ballads. Heard today, \"Elverskud\" fits the Danish romance style, particularly in the section where Oluf, the mother and the choir \"talk\" to each other in opera style.\n\"Elverskud\" has been shown to be one of the most popular Gade's works. According to a statement in Inger Sørensen's book, it was performed at least 184 times in Gade's life, a success unparalleled by other Danish composers. The work remains popular today, and two of the songs, \"I østen stiger solen op\" and \"Så tit jeg rider mig under ø\" are often played as single pieces.\n\n"}

It provides resources and information that are helpful for the everyday activities of women and as a source of entertainment and subject matter relevant to women.\nHistory.\nOriginally called the Women's Liberation Front in 1971, WRAC was established to promote women's rights and equality, and allow women to meet other women as friends, classmates, coworkers, etc. WRAC's website states that members of the organization \"met to discuss their shared oppression as women and search for solutions to their common problems.\" In 1974, the group changed its name to that which it currently holds: Women's Resource and Action Center.\nWhen the organization was created, the members made it an issue to function collectively rather than have an officer team or executive board, to encourage women's empowerment and not be discriminatory. After WRAC had successfully established itself as a feminist group in the Iowa City community, it began to reach out to other oppressed groups, diversifying their human rights values to expand to groups including \"people of color, people with disabilities, the elderly, and lesbians and gays.\" Originally, as a source of education and entertainment, WRAC held workshops and programs such as counseling, divorce rights, abortion and birth control, women's health information, women's studies, self-defense, economics, etc. These workshops and programs were beneficial to all women involved with WRAC because of the knowledge they were obtaining.\nIn the early 1980s, the Women Against Racism Committee (WAR) was formed as a branch of WRAC, and populated primarily by the members of WRAC, as well as other women in the Iowa City community. The original purpose of the organization was to critique the racism WRAC members perceived, and to raise awareness of the harmful effects of internalized racism. These actions evolved into the study of all forms of oppression, including sexism, disability-related discrimination, and homophobia, especially among colored women. As WAR grew in popularity, it brought in renowned speakers, such as Winona LaDuke and Natalie Wong to the University of Iowa campus to speak on behalf of the oppressed populations. In 1988, WAR held its first and only national conference, \"Parallels and Intersections: Racism and Other Forms of Oppression.\" Participation in the Women Against Racism Committee declined throughout the 1990s until it was shut down in 1998.\nPresent day.\nMission and values.\nWRAC is a feminist organization designed to promote equality between groups, with a more focused goal on establishing women's rights. Their values include inclusivity, collaboration, diversity, effectiveness, safe and supportive environment, and respect.\nPrograms.\nWRAC offers services including counseling, scholarships, support groups, and a library containing resources that address financing, health care (women's health, abuse recovery, eating disorders), gender studies, LGBT studies, marriage, sex, parenting, feminism theory, domestic violence, single parenting, adoption, and literature. The Center has also helped teach bystander intervention classes that were open to all members of the community to combat the issue of street harassment in Iowa City in 2014. To combat the issue of street harassment in Iowa City in 2014, the Center helped teach bystander intervention classes that were open to all members of the community \nStudent life.\nWRAC has organized \"Take Back The Night\" rallies, an event including a march in advocation of sexual violence victims and an open-mic time for victims to tell their stories that has been ongoing since 1979. Since 2014 the University of Iowa has had a new focus on decreasing sexual assaults on campus. Because of this, WRAC has increased their staff and resources and has been able to reach more students. The organization has grown too large for its current location on Madison Street where the Center has been for 39 years. With the development of these events, the organization plans to move to a new location (the Bowman house on Clinton Street in Iowa City) in 2016.\nSafety.\nWRAC has been providing safety resources for years. Whether it be in their office or online, there are many different options. For example, on their website, it lists hotlines for immediate assistance as well as counselling and care for victims of sexual assault.\nOne of WRAC's projects to fight sexual violence and increase safety was the Street Lighting and Safety Project. WRAC acted as an advisor to the Association of Student Women (ASW) and collaborated with them to complete the project. The goal of the Street Lighting and Safety Project was to have more street lights put in place around Iowa City to provide more lighting during the evenings and at night. WRAC and ASW began the project in 1976 and it was completed in 1980. The lights put up around the campus acted as a precursor to current lights and blue safety lights around campus today.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48692630","title":"Fiber modification","body":"\nFiber modification\n\nFibre modification is a research field in which researchers aim at developing and applying technologies to impart new properties to natural fibres such as those in paper, in order to increase their functionality. Research areas in this field include many different technologies, amongst which the chemical modifications of fibres are widely used. One important sector of application of the chemical modifications is the treatment of wood for giving it enhanced properties such as higher mechanical properties, water impermeability, less hygroscopicity, bacterial and fungal resistance. Transferring and adapting the technical knowledge on fibre modification available for the wood sector to the recycled paper sector is an innovative use of these chemical treatments which has been the subject of studies that have been carried out within an EU co-funded project called Fibre+.\nThe project Consortium included members representing Paper and Packaging European Associations (CEPI, FEFCO), and research institutes specialized in the wood and paper for packaging sector and paper and packaging companies. The focus of the project was on chemical modification of the paper made recycled fibres, investigating the possibility to transfer wood fibre modifications technique from the wood sector to paper and packaging sector. The aim was to enhance the properties of papers and of the packaging, as the recycling process causes the deterioration of fibres.\nThe chemical modification of recycled fibres aimed at the creation of a new generation of packaging papers characterized for being more recyclable, less hygroscopic, stiff and durable. The high recycling rate of papers in Europe (which is at the level of 72%) and the consequent importance that recycling has for the circular economy, were at the basis of this study. Paper products form part of an integrated carbon cycle based on the photosynthetic conversion of water, carbon dioxide, nutrients and solar energy into renewable wood-based biomass. Once consumed, paper may be recovered and used again either as a source of secondary fibres, to produce recycled paper or as bio-fuel. Fibre packages or corrugated containers made from corrugated board were the ones that were dealt with in the project, as they are considered as being the most prominent structural application of paper.\nChemical modification attempts.\nFibre modification with chemicals or enzymes had been investigated in the production of fibreboards. Fibre modification applying steam (steam-exploded wood) has been proved an efficient pre-treatment method in producing thermoplastic composites.\nCurrent theories for interfibre bonding during papermaking process are based on general recognition of the hydrogen bonding model. Consequently, all effort for boosting fibre strength is connected to mechanical beating of fibres in order to generate more flexible and fragmented fibres for increased bonding areas. As a consequence, significant drawbacks are obtained in terms of water retention ratio resulting in poor dewatering behaviour and high energy consumption. New mechanisms for interpretation and control of interfibre bonding are still upcoming. One way to overcome these drawbacks could be the molecular coating of cellulose fibres using polymers targeted on entropy controlled mixing of polymers and cellulose gel resulting in higher bonding forces. Theoretical results as well as experimental data on how application of polymeric layers (e.g. carboxymethyl cellulose) and enzymes on cellulose fibres can lead to sheets of high bonding strength without any mechanical beating have been already presented. However, these attempts were still far from any industrial implementation and their application would have been costly and would not solve the problem of raw material availability.\nObjective.\nBased on this state-of-the-art, the objective of the project was to modify and thus improve the characteristics of different types of recovered fibres used for the production of a variety of packaging grade papers used as linerboard and corrugating medium for corrugated board manufacturing in Europe. Information on the actual furnish characteristics and composition of packaging materials is expected to help European packaging industry to evaluate its sources of supply and to adopt suitable methods and processes to improve the available resources in an optimal manner. In the case of packaging, scientific technical knowledge of practical industrial relations between fibre characteristics, paper properties and corrugated board properties also is needed.\nFrom wood fibre modification to paper technology chemical wood modification aims at altering the structure of the cell wall matrix. Wood\nproperties are improved considerably by converting hydrophilic OH-groups into larger more hydrophobic groups. Also the physical fixation of modifying chemicals in the cell wall matrix can considerably change the wood properties. In addition to a hydrophobing effect, the treatments reduce the volume of cell wall nano-pores and thus decrease the incorporation of water molecules into the cell wall matrix. On a macroscopic scale, wood modification can change important properties of the wood including biological durability (resistance against fungi), dimensional stability, hardness and UV-stability. \nSince paper is produced from wood fibres, it was possible to transfer some of the developments achieved in wood technology to paper technology. Several technologies (e.g. chemical modification, nano-scale celluloses, polyelectrolytes, functional polymers based on cellulose, hemicelluloses and starch) were researched and used by different research groups around Europe (e.g. PTS and University of Goettingen, Germany; Kungliga Tekniska högskolan (KTH), Sweden.) There is already well established knowledge on chemical fibre modification of recycled fibres. Adamopoulos and Mai (2011) modified recycled fibres with N-methylol compounds and glutaraldehyde with significant improvement on fibre characteristics and paper sheet performance. Laboratory sheets manufactured with a variety of chemically modified recycled fibres were found to be superior in stiffness and hygroscopic properties than these manufactured from unmodified ones. The intention of the Fibre+ project is to build on the existing knowledge on fibre modification for adapting, implementing and disseminating this innovative technology in European paper SMEs.\nResults of the Fibre+ project on recycled fibres for packaging paper and information on potential developments of the Fibre+ concept can be found pn the Fibre+ website including scientific articles that have been published as a consequence of the RTD work that has been carried out during the project. \n\n"}

Zion) Church and a professor of ministry with research interests in Practical Theology, Congregational Studies and Leadership, Ethnography, Evangelism and Church Planting, Black Church Studies, and Urban Church Ministry. Academics and professionals in these fields consider him a renowned thought leader. Tribble's experience in pastoral ministry allows for his work to bridge the gap between academic research and practical church leadership.\nCareer.\nTribble received a B.S. from Howard University (1981), a Black Minister’s Program Certificate from Hartford Seminary (1985), a M.Div. from Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary (1990), and a Ph.D. from Northwestern University (2002). He began his work in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church as a minister of membership development at Martin Temple A.M.E. Zion Church in Chicago, Illinois (1990–1991). Tribble was ordained as an elder in 1992, when he then served as the pastor at St. Andrew A.M.E. Zion Church in Gary, Indiana (1991–1997). He has also served in the A.M.E. Zion Church as a pastor at St. Mark church in Chicago, Illinois (1997–2000), co-pastor at New vision Church in Suwanee, Georgia (2007–2008), Associate pastor at Greater Walters church in Chicago, Illinois (2006–2007), the minister of evangelism and men’s ministry and founding Dean of the Life Development Institute at Martin Temple Church in Chicago, Illinois (2000–2006), and as the presiding elder for the A.M.E. Zion Church for the Augusta District (2008–2013) and the Atlanta District (2013–present).\nHe began his career as an academic at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary where he served as adjunct faculty (1999–2000, 2008 and 2009), Instructor of Congregational Ministries and Director of Teaching Parishes and Congregational Research (July 2000 – June 2003) and Assistant Professor of Congregational Leadership and Director of the Center for the Church and the Black Experience (July 2003 – June 2007). He has been a lecturer at Apex School of Theology in Durham, NC (2009). He joined the faculty of Columbia Theological Seminary as Assistant Professor of Ministry (2007–2012). \nHe currently still serves at Columbia Theological Seminary where he is now the Associate Professor of Ministry. He is also Presiding Elder for the Atlanta District, Georgia Annual Conference and Candidate for Bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church for 2016.\nThought.\nTribble is a strong proponent of the transformative leadership idea. He has written extensively about how leaders, especially those who work in the church, should be open to transformation themselves as they transform the community they are leading. He writes about this specifically from the perspective of the Black Church in two of his books, Transformative Pastoral Leadership in the Black Church and Joining Jesus: A Class Manual for initiation into Christian Discipleship and Welcome into the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. From this point of view he emphasizes his research on how the Black Church “must continue its historic mission of being an instrument of survival, elevation, and liberation for its people.” He however does not limit his research just to the Black Church, he pushes for transformative leadership between various religious traditions as well. He has published numerous books, articles, and chapters that are used in this context by people and institutions across the world and across denominational lines.\n\n"}

She served as a faculty member of Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology and Department of Neurobiology and Behavior and taught graduate students while conducting research until retiring as of October 2010. She currently resides in Ithaca, New York, with her husband, Jack Bradbury.\nEducation.\nShe graduated from Crescenta Valley High School in La Crescenta, California, in 1965. She went on to receive her bachelors in Zoology with honors from the University of California at Berkeley in 1970, and her Ph.D in Animal Behavior from Cornell University in 1976. After her extensive education, she started her career in research.\nPersonal and early life.\nDr. Vehrencamp grew up in La Crescenta, California, and attended Crescenta Valley High School. During the time period Sandra Vehrencamp was born, women’s scientific talents were substantially under-appreciated. She received her high-school diploma in 1965 and went on to pursue a higher education from there. However, before 1950, women earned less than 10% of Bachelor’s in the STEM fields and less than 5% of the PhDs in these fields. She grew up with this stigma surrounding her and still managed to attend the University of California at Berkeley for her bachelors and Cornell University for her doctorate. The percentages of women receiving bachelors and PhDs were steadily rising throughout her young life, although the year she graduated from Cornell University still less than 10% of doctorates were received by women. Scientific women of the time were quite rare, and this fact highlights her dedication and passion for science, as is noted by other scientists. While in the midst of her education at Cornell University, she met her spouse-to-be, Jack Bradbury. They had their first child in 1975, just a year before Vehrencamp received her PhD and started her career. Their second child was born in 1979, when Vehrencamp was just beginning to settle into a career path. These few starting years were hectic for Vehrencamp, and it has been noted how impressive it is that she managed to keep furthering her career the way she did. Her oldest daughter, Kristin Nobel, is currently married and has two kids, her family living in San Diego. Her youngest, Katrina Bradbury, lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and is a Nutrition and Wellness Coach at The Sacred Healing Room at Your Natural Solutions LLC.\nCareer.\nSince 1976 she worked with University of California at San Diego and Cornell University conducting intensive research about birds and their behavior, specifically song patterns and mating habits. She taught animal communication research methods in animal behavior to graduate students during her time at Cornell University, and currently holds a professor emerita position there. Vehrencamp is said to have been an outstanding mentor, teacher, and scientist by her graduate students. Additionally, she worked with the Laboratory of Ornithology Bioacoustics Research Program and contributed to the bird call section, specifically that of Costa Rican wrens; she still holds an emerita professor appointment there as well. Throughout her career she published over 65 papers, which have been cited more than 2,400 times, and wrote 19 book chapters. She collaborated with her husband, Jack Bradbury - an ornithologist as well - consistently during her time as a scientist. They co-wrote a textbook, Principles of Animal Communication, published in 1998. It is a widely used work that combines physics, chemistry, neurobiology, cognitive science, evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, and economics to delve deeply into animals and how they signal and communicate with one another. Its importance is highlighted by the fact that it has been cited more than 1,000 times. This textbook is highly regarded in the scientific community and is revered as the standard reference of the animal behavior world.\nNotable research ventures.\nVehencamp spent decades of her life studying ornithology, and retired fully accomplished in 2010. Her detailed work earned several awards soon after.\n\n"}

While he still considers the album to be jazz-oriented, he stated that he stayed away from swing-style music \"because I didn't think solo guitar was the format for me to play swing\".\nOverview.\nThe first track, \"40's\", which was the only song given a pre-release, is of a medium tempo and alternates between the keys of F and D. \"Peru\" opens with some light picking before settling into the actual tune, and \"Japan\" begins \"with an angular, almost discordant sound, but enters into a laid back groove, occasionally interrupted by unsettled harmonies\".\n\"Double Stops\", as the title implies, makes extensive use of double stops throughout the course of the song. \"Gardens\" was described as making Lage sound like \"a flatpicking Andrés Segovia\", due to the fast bluegrass picking technique employed.\nOnly two tracks on the album were not composed by Lage. The first, \"Where or When\", a Rodgers and Hart show tune, was described as \"[lingering] like a comfortable memory.\" The other is a folk song, \"Red Prairie Dawn\", which \"puts his folk roots on display.\"\nReception.\nMark F. Turner's \"AllAboutJazz\" review said that \"It's the perfect showcase of his fine abilities on acoustic guitar.\" \"Relix\" review said that \"the music's austerity magnifies its grandeur\".\nThe review from \"The Stanford Daily\" stated that \"Fans of Lage's more experimental work...may be disappointed to find that \"World's Fair\" lacks the abstract sophistication found in many works of contemporary jazz. But it's fairly clear that Lage was not writing to push musical boundaries, but rather to pay homage to the diverse range of music that has shaped his own playing and taste.\" The Sun Gazette commented \"Lage [serves] the songs rather than his ego...the brilliance is in how simple and effortless he makes it sound\".\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48692957","title":"Maria Fidecaro","body":"\nMaria Fidecaro\n\nMaria Fidecaro is an Italian theoretical physicist with a focus on particle physics. Her main laboratory where she spent most of her career doing research was CERN- European Organization for Nuclear Research.\nMaria received her degrees in Physics from the University of Rome in the 1940s.\nIn 1954, she obtained a fellowship from the International Federation of University Women to do research at the University of Liverpool. In 1956, Maria obtained the CERN fellowship and worked at CERN until 2012. She is among the pioneering scientists at CERN since the establishment of the institution in 1954.\nPersonal life.\nMaria Fidecaro was born in Italy. In July 1955, she married Giuseppe Fidecaro- a fellow physicist at CERN who was also doing research with Maria at University of Liverpool. They had a family of four children.\nIn summer 1956 when Maria obtained CERN fellowship, the couple moved to Geneva. They were the first few scientists among a total of 300 to 400 staff when CERN was first founded. During their time, few people could do experiments at CERN. Maria started with a group of only three scientists.\nMaria also recalled the effect of war in her early life. Italy entered World War II in 1940, the time when Maria was earning her degree at the University of Rome. The aftermath of war destroyed Italy’s economy and society. Not until the 1950s and 1960s had Italy regained its stabilization and the economy started booming.\n\"It was just a mere 10 years after the end of the war. The war feelings were still very much there,\" she recalled as she started her work at CERN in 1956.\nAlthough there were few female scientists at CERN during her time, Maria felt she was respected by her colleagues. “In my group, I was simply one of them”, Maria said.\nThe couple, having devoted 60 years to research at CERN since its beginning, is seen as a living memory of the institute.\nScientific research.\nAfter Maria’s marriage, she and Giuseppe carried out experiments on pions. Maria worked with a diffusion chamber and Giuseppe with a lead glass Cherenkov counter.\nMaria and Giuseppe were also involved in cosmic rays experiment in the Italian Alps just after the war. The experiment was set at 3,500 meters on the face of Matterhorn, using a detector of 1-square meter.\nAfter Maria and Giuseppe moved to Geneva, Giuseppe was assigned to the Synchrocyclotron Division. Synchrocyclotron was the first accelerator to be built at CERN in 1957. Meanwhile, Maria worked on a novel method to provide polarized proton beams to be used for particle collision in the accelerator.\nThroughout her career as a theoretical physicist, she authored over 200 publications in the fields of Nuclear Physics, Nuclear Energy, and Statistical Physics. Maria collaborated with 903 co-authors in her research from 1961 to 2012.\nThe majority of her research relates directly to the experiments, including interpreting the measurements and results in the search for new particles. In Maria’s early works in the 1960s, she studied the nucleon-nucleon charge exchange scattering, recorded data on high-energy electrodynamic processes.\nHer research work also tackled the phenomenon of proton-proton elastic scattering. In the 1990s, she investigated the design and test of a prototype gas-sampling electromagnetic calorimeter of high granularity and collaborated on the construction of a position-sensitive photon detector for CPLEAR experiment. CPLEAR experiment aims to carry out precision measurements of CP, T and CPT violation of the neutral kaon systems.\nMaria’s other work focused on phenomenological aspects of particle physics. She studied the fundamental symmetries in the neutral kaon systems. By the measurements of interactions and decays of neutral kaons, new and detailed information was found on CPT invariance in time evolution and decay. The newly achieved level of precision of the experiments called into question the validity of some of the often tacitly assumed hypotheses in particle physics.\nMaria was also involved in the search for CP-violation (charge-parity violation) in the NA48 experiment. After the theory of CP-violation in the decay of neutral kaon system was experimentally confirmed, the discovery brought the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1980 to the discoverers of the theories, James Cronin, and Val Fitch. The discovery played an important role in helping scientists explain the dominance of matter over antimatter.\nChallenges as a women scientist.\nFemale scientists at CERN have to face certain obstacles. A trend is observed that when women scientists reach their mid-career and have children, they tend to leave their job. Even today, there are no pre-schools at CERN and those around the laboratory are expensive. Pregnancy can pose a challenge to the career advancement of women scientists because they have more limited access to the facilities due to the risk of radiation.\nWhen CERN was first founded, there were about 300 to 400 staff but very few women scientists. Some gender issues at CERN were mentioned in the book “Women Scientists: Reflections, Challenges, and Breaking Boundaries” by Magdoha Hargittai. Mary Katharine Gaillard, a theoretical physicist holding a visiting position at CERN in the 1960s was interviewed in the book. Gaillard conducted a survey among women scientists at CERN at that time and found that only 10 percent was fully paid while 86 percent was not paid at all. Two of the reasons for women scientists not being paid were that their husbands were CERN employees and that priority was given to unemployed men. Maria Fidecaro might have experienced the gender bias mentioned by Gaillard during her time at CERN in the 1960s since her husband, Giuseppe Fidecaro, was an employee at CERN. Additionally, Maria had to juggle the job and a family of four children. There were few nurseries in CERN and around the laboratory at that time.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48693068","title":"Embla (horse)","body":"\nEmbla (horse)\n\nEmbla (27 April 1983 – after 2003) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In a racing career which lasted from June 1985 until October 1986 she won four of her nine races. As a two-year-old she finished second on her debut and won two minor races before recording an upset victory over a strong field for the Cheveley Park Stakes. In the following year she finished fifth in the 1000 Guineas and second in the Coronation Stakes before ending her career with a win in the Petition Stakes. Her broodmare career was largely undistinguished but she produced one excellent racehorse in Zenno El Cid, a major winner in Japan.\nBackground.\nEmbla was a \"strong, rangy\" dark bay mare with no white markings bred in the United Kingdom by Sheikh Mohammed. She was sired by Dominion who finished third in the 1975 2000 Guineas and won the Prix Perth in 1976. before being exported to North America and winning the Bernard Baruch Handicap in 1978. He sired several good horses over a wide range of distances including First Island, the sprinter Primo Dominie (Coventry Stakes), and the stayer Trainglot (Cesarewitch Handicap). Embla's dam Kaftan won one minor race from four attempts but was a half-sister to the Nunthorpe Stakes winner Blue Cashmere and a granddaughter of the Yorkshire Oaks runner-up No Saint, whose other descendants included Persian Heights.\nAs a yearling Embla was offered for sale and bought for 46,000 guineas by representatives of Charles St George. The filly was sent into training with Luca Cumani at Newmarket, Suffolk.\nRacing career.\n1985: two-year-old season.\nEmbla began her racing career by finishing second in a minor race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in late June. She then started favourite for an eighteen-runner maiden race at Kempton Park Racecourse in July and won easily. On her next appearance she was less impressive as she started 1/5 favourite for a minor event at Ripon Racecourse in August but won by only three-quarters of a length from Raisinhell. Timeform described her as \"scrambling home\" in the race. Cumani, nevertheless, held the filly in high regard and later explained that she had been going through an \"awkward growing phase\" at the time.\nOn her final appearance of the year, Embla was moved up sharply in class to contest the Cheveley Park Stakes (the only Group One race in Britain at the time restricted to juvenile fillies) over six furlongs at Newmarket in October. The leading American jockey Angel Cordero was booked for the ride, but the filly was given little chance and started a 20/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field. The Jeremy Tree-trained Kingcote started favourite after a four-length win in the Lowther Stakes, whilst the other contenders included Park Express, Storm Star (winner of the Cherry Hinton Stakes), Asteroid Field (Waterford Candelabra Stakes), Bambolona (Sirenia Stakes), Wanton (third in the Flying Childers Stakes), Nashia (runner-up in the Prix d'Arenberg) and Rose of the Sea (fourth in the Prix Morny). In the early stages Rose of the Sea led from Storm Star, with Embla towards the rear and apparently struggling to match the pace. Kingscote went to the front approaching the final furlong but Embla was making relentless progress and soon moved into contention. She overtook Kingscote a hundred yards from the finish and won by a length. Rose of the Sea held on for third ahead of Asteroid Field.\n1986: three-year-old season.\nOn her three-year-old debut Embla contested the Nell Gwyn Stakes (a trial race for the 1000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 15 April and finished fourth of the nine runners behind Sonic Lady. Sixteen days later she started 6/1 second favourite behind behind Sonic Lady in the 1000 Guineas. Ridden by Tony Ives she finished fifth behind Midway Lady, Maysoon, Sonic Lady and Ala Mahlik. She proved no match for Sonic Lady in her next two races, finishing second in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and fifth in the Child Stakes at Newmarket on 9 July. After a break of three months the filly returned and was dropped in class for the Petition Stakes over one mile at Newmarket in October. She recorded her only success of the year as she narrowly defeated the colt Santella Mac.\nAssessment.\nIn the official International Classification for 1985, Embla was rated the third-best two-year-old filly in Europe after the French-trained Baiser Vole and Regal State. The independent Timeform organisation rated her on 121, three pounds behind their top juvenile filly Femme Elite. She was rated 110 by Timeform in 1986.\nBreeding record.\nEmbla was retired from racing to become a broodmare and produced eleven foals between 1988 and 2003. Three of her offspring won races, with the most successful, by far, being the Japanese horse Zenno El Cid.\n\n"}

The main span is (two spans) and the bridge has a total length of . It is named after U.S. President Abraham Lincoln.\nHistory.\nThe Abraham Lincoln Bridge opened on December 6, 2015, and is parallel to the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge upstream and carries three lanes of northbound I-65 traffic, eventually carrying six lanes of northbound I-65 traffic. Pedestrian and bicycle lanes were in the original plans, but have since been removed. The existing I-65 John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge, completed in 1963, will be renovated for six lanes of southbound traffic.\nA Structured Public Involvement protocol developed by Drs. K. Bailey and T. Grossardt was used to elicit public preferences for the design of the structure. From spring 2005 to summer 2006 several hundred citizens attended a series of public meetings in Louisville, Kentucky and Jeffersonville, Indiana and evaluated a range of bridge design options using 3D visualizations. This public involvement process focused in on designs that the public felt were more suitable, as shown by their polling scores. The SPI public involvement process itself was evaluated by anonymous, real-time citizen polling at the open public meetings.\nOn July 19, 2006, the final design alternatives for the bridge were announced. The three designs included a three-span arch, a cable-stayed design with three towers, and a cable-stayed type with a single A-shaped support tower. It was also announced that the projected cost for the bridge would be $203 million.\nThe structure is an additional bridge in downtown Louisville joining the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge erected between spring 1961 and late 1963 at a cost of $10 million; the four-lane George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge, constructed from June 1928 and to October 31, 1929, and the Big Four Bridge, which operated as a railroad bridge from 1895 to 1969 and reopened as a pedestrian bridge in May 2014.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48693231","title":"Fruit carving","body":"\nFruit carving\n\nFruit carving is the art of carving fruit, a very common technique in Europe and Asian countries, and particularly popular in Thailand, China and Japan. There are many fruits that can be used in this process; the most popular one that artists use are watermelons, apples, strawberries, pineapples, and cantaloupes.\nHistory.\nChina.\nMany believe that fruit carving originated in China during the Tang Dynasty, which lasted from AD 618-906. Fruit carving in China usually features mythological creatures, and animals. Not only is fruit carving used in cultural and traditional ceremonies, but also ordinary households are known for decorating plates with fruit carvings when they have guests over. Specifically, watermelon carving has been and still is very popular in China. Usually, the outside of the melon is carved on and the melon pulp is scraped out of the inside of the melon, so it can be used as a container to put food or flowers in. Chinese fruit carving is used to tell their legends and stories.\nEurope.\nFruit carving is included in Matthias Giegher's 1621 work \"Il Trinciante\" (\"The Carver\"), where he describes carving oranges and citrons into abstract patterns, shell-fish, four-legged animals and the Hapsburgs' double-headed eagle, but the art was not common in Europe or North America until the 1980s when several books on the topic were published.\nThailand.\nFruit carving is a significant part of Thai cultural heritage. Watermelon carving dates to the 14th century in Thailand during the Sukhothai dynasty. The annual Loi Krathong Festiva occurs each November where people in Thailand float lamps and lanterns down a river to honor water spirits. One legend is that one of the king’s maids decorated her lantern with a watermelon carved with flower designs to impress him and that he was so pleased that he encouraged all Thai women to adopt the practice. The king also requested that fruit carving become part of the primary school curriculum. Thailand fruit carving features flowers, birds and floral patterns.\nJapan.\nThe Japanese emphasize the presentation of a dish and how the plate aesthetically appeals to others. Fruit carving in Japan is referred to as Mukimono. Mukimono began in ancient Japan in an effort to make dishes more appealing since the food was placed and served on an unglazed pottery plate, which had a rough look to it. Chefs would cover the plate in leaves and would fold them into different designs in order to make the dish look better.This technique eventually turned into carving fruit that would also be placed on the plates to enhance the appearance of the dish. At first, when this technique came out, vendors on the streets would add carved fruit to their food when customers made a special request, but now it is very common for all Japanese dishes to feature carved fruits. Fruit carving and garnishing is now a significant part of Japanese chef training.\nOverview.\nThe art of fruit carving uses many different tools, usually ordinary items but some specific to just fruit carving. All these tools give the artwork a different texture or help with its design. Some of the tools include:\nBefore carving a fruit, the necessary materials must be gathered. The usual process is to have the tools handy for when they are needed in one's steps towards creating a carving. There are two types of carvings that can be done. The first is Skin Carving, this is when the outer skin of the fruit (or vegetable) is carved to reveal the fleshy center, where the color is different than the outer skin to create a design using the contrast between the outer skin and flesh of the fruit. The second type of carving is Three Dimensional Carving, the purpose of this particular technique of carving is to carve the fruit to into a three dimensional object of the carver’s choice. The most popular three dimensional design is floral objects. It is easy to over-carve a fruit which leads to loss in nutrition, but it is always important to start off by outlining your carving on the fruit. Depending on the design that is being created it may take very little time or be more complex and use more time and concentration also different steps in the process are used for each design. Not one design is alike. An important aspect of fruit carving is that the fruit you carve must be suitable for the manner which one will display it. Most fruit carvings will need to be refrigerated before they are placed in the specific setting that is desired.\nArtists.\nThere are many artists and chefs who are known for their fruit carving skills. Each has a different technique. Many of these chefs have previously owned restaurants and now hold classes in this art. \nValeriano Fatica is an Italian fruit carver, known through his videos on Youtube that has attracted people to his artwork around the world. He has carved many different fruits at a large scale.\nJimmy Zhang is a fruit carver from China. He has won many awards in the culinary area and has also been featured in many newspapers across the globe for his skills. He teaches classes on how to carve fruit and vegetables and master the skills and learn history about the way China has created its fruit carving industry.\nCarl Franklin Jones, an expert in the art of fruit carving, practices in the United States. He is known for his fruit carving sculpture that was created for Ivanka Trump's wedding. He also holds a catering businesses in Tennessee. Jones was a business owner of many franchises also in Tennessee before starting his catering business. Today Jones travels the world and hosts mentoring programs for young ambitious fruit carving artists and chefs.\nFruit carving today.\nSome people perform fruit carving professionally. Some chefs utilize fruit carving as a culinary technique. Once fruit carvers have mastered the techniques past the intermediate stage and become professionals, they can price their services to restaurants, professional caterers, hotels and resorts. Professional fruit carvers can also create centerpieces and displays for various events, such as parties and wedding receptions. On a smaller scale, fruit carvers can present a dish with decorative garnishing to add an aesthetically pleasing experience to their viewers.\n\n"}

It was built in the Baroque style between 1726 and 1728, to designs of the French architect Charles François de Mondion. The building is linked to Palazzo Vilhena, but it has its own entrance and façade.\nHistory.\nThe Corte Capitanale was built between 1726 and 1728 along with the rest of Palazzo Vilhena, the Grand Master's official residence in Mdina. The building was mainly a courthouse, but it also served as the seat of the \"Capitano della Verga\". Its linking to the palace was a symbolic gesture to convey the fact that the courts were under the jurisdiction of the Order of St. John. The courthouse was also linked to the Bishop's Palace through a now-blocked underground passage, indicating the Church's role in the courts. The building remained a courthouse until 1818.\nToday, the Corte Capitanale is Mdina's city hall, being the seat of the city's local council. The council considers the building as inadequate, and in 2012 it requested to move its premises to the Banca Giuratale.

Its leadership included Chit Hlaing, U Pu and U Kyaw Dun. The new party held rallies to pressurise the British to extend the self-government plans to Burma. A proposal known as the Craddock Plan to give ethnic minorities separate representation was opposed by the GCBA, which saw it as an attempt at divide and rule.\nIn 1922 the British agreed to extend the Indian system to Burma, and elections were scheduled for November. However, this caused a split in the GCBA, with the majority calling for a boycott and others calling for participation in the elections. This eventually led to 21 dissidents leaving to form the 21 Party, which emerged as the largest faction in the Legislative Council following the elections.\nThe GCBA split again in the build-up to the 1925 elections due to differences over another boycott, as well as the organisation's finances and the role of monks. Dissidents left to form the U Chit Hlaing Faction, which subsequently splintered into the Home Rule Party and the Hlaing-Myat-Paw GCBA. The rump of the GCBA became known as the Soe Thein GCBA, named after its leader U Soe Thein.\nAnother split occurred in 1929 when the organisation was split into the Ye-U group led by U Su and the Thetpan Sayadaws led by U Soe Thein. The latter collapsed in the early 1930s and many of its members joined other parties to contest elections. By 1932 the GCBA was effectively defunct, although its name continued to be used by some parties, including the United GCBA established in 1936.\n\n"}

During his tenure as bishop, Athanasius is known to have used church funds to obtain the support of the Caliph Marwan II to strengthen his position.\nBy 742/743, Athanasius had been granted the title of Metropolitan of Mesopotamia, potentially due to the simultaneous growth and decline of Maiperqat and Amid respectively, as well as the decrepitude of Severus, Bishop of Amid.\nAs metropolitan, Athanasius granted his student Isaiah of Ashparin administrative control of the greater part of the diocese of Amid as a result of Severus' inability to lead the diocese. During the late 740s, however, this appointment caused Athanasius to come into conflict with the patriarch Iwannis I who ordained a certain Abay, former Bishop of Arzun, as the new bishop of Amid. This conflict was exacerbated by Iwannis' failure to ordain Dionysius, Athanasius' appointment to the empty see of Tur Abdin, after the death of its former incumbent Athanasius of Nunib. \nAt the Synod of Tella in 752, Athanasius expanded his authority as metropolitan from the area of the former Roman province of Mesopotamia to the entirety of Upper Mesopotamia through the use of implicit threats of reprisals from the Muslim authorities, despite the protests of the bishops. Athanasius commemorated his success with the erection of a new cathedral in the city of Maiperqat. He later used his new authority to ordain his student Iwannis Isaac as Bishop of Harran and depose the bishops of Samosata and Singara. Athanasius also succeeded in having Iwannis Isaac ordained as the patriarch and successor to Iwannis I in 754. Daniel, son of Moses of Tur Abdin, later claimed that Athanasius secured Iwannis' elevation to the patriarchal office by organising the election fraudulently.

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48693543","title":"Mary Bartlett Bunge","body":"\nMary Bartlett Bunge\n\nMary Bartlett Bunge (born 1941) is a distinguished American neuroscientist currently researching a cure for paralysis at University of Miami, where she is a Professor of Cell Biology. Bunge was born in a time where women were still in separate spheres from men and limited by society to domestic life. She challenged these expectations set by society and followed her passion for science, becoming an inspirational role model for women today.\nEarly life.\nMary Bartlett was born on April 3, 1931 in New Haven, Connecticut to George Chapman Bartlett and Margaret Elizabeth Reynolds Bartlett. Her father built and renovated houses, including the house in which she grew up, whereas her mother worked as a painter and decorator. Neither of her parents had a college education, and her father thought that a college education was useless for women. Their careers were filled with an artistic expression that Mary found appealing. After her grandmother taught her how to sew, she expressed herself through art and fashion by designing and making all of her own clothes with the ultimate dream to be a fashion designer in New York City. She strongly considered this career in fashion design, but eventually decided her art interests could just be hobbies. She was also interested in the sciences from a very young age, even though it was not considered a traditional option for women at the time. She developed this passion for biology when she was exploring the stream near her home in her leaky little row boat. She observed the tadpoles swimming around her and questioned how they developed into frogs. Unlike her art interests, she knew that in order to pursue her childhood passion for biology, she would need to acquire a higher education.\nEducation.\nMary Bartlett made the first step towards this higher education when she attended Simmons College in Boston to become a laboratory technician. This defied expectations for women at the time as the 1950s female college student was encouraged to marry, start a family, and put an end to her education. Only about a third of the women who entered college during the decade actually graduated. Only ten percent of working women entered a profession during this time. They instead settled for the traditional employment in secretarial, clerical, nursing, teaching, assembly lines, and domestic service, which were considered appropriate for women.\nDespite these statistics, Mary persevered, and at the end of her junior year at Simmons College, she was inspired to further her education while attending a program at Jackson Memorial Laboratory, where she witnessed a rabbit’s heart contract in a tissue culture. This instance triggered the realization that she did not want to be a lab tech; she wanted to do research, so when she graduated from Simmons College in 1953, she accepted the invitation to graduate school at University of Wisconsin Medical School from Dr. Robert Schilling. He was a professor in the Department of Medical Physiology who offered Mary a research assistantship position when she was studying to obtain her masters degree. They researched intrinsic factor, which is lacking from the gastric juices when one has the condition of pernicious anemia and cannot absorb vitamin B12. Their research had a clinical relevance that influenced her later research to be focused toward clinical applications. This work was the basis of her thesis, which allowed her to graduate with her masters degree in medical physiology in 1955.\nThere was implicit bias in society that women were not competent enough to excel in the science profession, so they were not always taken seriously when trying to attain this goal. Mary noted that Dr. Schilling was an exception to this and was an outstanding mentor to her. He helped set the high standards for her manuscripts when she was initially getting published. Women at the time struggled to get their work published because of the gender discrimination. When the author listed was a female name, people tended to reject the paper or not even read it, so women had to use their initials. Then, the author could not be labeled male or female, and the women had a better chance for equal evaluation of the work.\nWhile studying for her doctorate at University of Wisconsin Medical School, Mary worked in the Zoology Department with Dr. Hans Ris, who she also regarded as an outstanding mentor. She was grateful for his willingness to advise a young woman as she faced the extra challenges simply due to her gender. She noted that both of her two mentors, Dr. Schilling and Dr. Ris, greatly shaped and benefited her future. They were able to be gender blind when others could not and treated her as just another graduate student. With their support, she successfully graduated with her doctorate in 1960.\nPersonal life.\nWhile at the University of Wisconsin, Mary met a medical student named Richard Bunge, whom she married and shared her personal life as well as her career. They graduated together and moved to Columbia University to begin their post-doctorate research. Soon after settling in, the family doubled with the addition of two sons, Jonathan, born in 1962, and Peter, born in 1964.\nSince women perform most of the caregiving in society, they face more challenges than men in pursuing high level positions while balancing the family responsibilities. Bunge faced these challenges head on and was able to continue her career while attending to her motherhood responsibilities, but not without sacrifices. To balance family and work life, Bunge worked part time for eight years as a Research Associate at Columbia University. It would have been too much for her to prepare lecture and teach on top of her research schedule and raising her sons, so she placed her tenure-track faculty member dream on hold.\nIn 1970, the family moved to accept faculty positions at Washington University School of Medicine. She chose to be a Research Assistant Professor rather than be on the tenure-track so she could continue raising her sons, who were still young. Instead, she adjusted to a full-time schedule. By 1974, she had started to teach and was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure. She was promoted again in 1978 to Professor. She was grateful for the quality of environment at Washington University, which made it possible for her to continue her career while being a part of her children's lives.\nResearch.\nRichard also enriched Mary’s life by introducing her to neuroscience, where she found her purpose and focused her research on while at Washington University School of Medicine. In particular, she focused on researching Schwann cells, which are cells that wrap around the axon of neurons to form the myelin sheath as an insulator to the neuron and to increase the speed impulses are conducted. One of her other major discoveries was that the oligodendrocyte was the cell that made the myelin sheath for the central nervous system. She first discovered this when she examined a section of a kitten’s spinal cord in an electron microscope with the oligodendrocyte cell body forming myelin at each end. She also demonstrated that myelin could be reformed in the mature mammalian spinal cord, which has an important clinical relevance in addressing Multiple Sclerosis and spinal cord injuries, where the myelin has been damaged.\nSince 1989, Bunge has been a leading part of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at University of Miami School of Medicine, where her research on myelin has been implemented. Her husband was invited to be the scientific director of the project, so she was able to work with him there, and when he died in 1996 from esophageal cancer, she took his place at the forefront of the project. This was a common way for women of this era to acquire leading roles in projects. Women used the careers of their husbands to gain access to the resources to further their own careers, and when they died, the women were able to take their place, avoiding possible gender discrimination. The project Bunge took over tests regeneration strategies that could lead to successful treatment of spinal cord injury.\nShe has the patent in “Schwann Cell Bridge Implants and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors to Stimulate CNS Nerve Regeneration” from 2009 for the application of restoring function after a central nervous system injury. She has dozens of other patents including \"Methods and Systems for Neural Maintenance and Regeneration,\" \"Promoters of Neural Regeneration,\" and \"Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors for Cognitive and Motor Rehabilitation.\" Her research is now being used for phase one of clinical trials, which gained approval from the FDA in 2012, to evaluate the safety of transplanting the Schwann cells of recently paralyzed patients into the site of their injury.\nPhase 1 of the clinical trial is the testing of the safety and efficacy of this technique. Each participant’s own Schwann cells are obtained from sural nerve biopsy, which is above the ankle. By obtaining these cells from the participants, there is minimal concern for immune rejection. The cells are then purified and processed in a culturing facility to generate the number of cells necessary to be transplanted into the injury site. This cell therapy is combined with an intense exercise and rehabilitation regiment over ten months for the trial. The participants are to be monitored for 5 years. So far, Phase 1 has shown promising results as millions of Schwann cells have been successfully transplanted into four subjects with no adverse effects.\nWhile the trial has been occurring, Bunge has been working on other combination treatments for future clinical trials. In 2014, she published in the Journal of Neuroscience the promising results of a strategy tested in rat Schwann cells that were engineered to secrete the growth factor D15A and the enzyme Chondroitinase ABC which alters scar composition. This combination lead to more axonal regeneration and functional improvement.\nBunge is extremely dedicated to her work, and although she considered retiring in 2010, she has remained in the lab to see through the success of the clinical trial.\nHonors.\nBunge has been a professor of cell biology, neurological surgery, and neurology at the University of Miami for 26 years now and has accumulated significant recognition for her research. In 1996, she received the Wakeman Award for Spinal Cord Repair. She is a three time recipient of the Javitis Neuroscience Investigator Award from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. She was the elected Chair of the Development of Women's Careers in Neuroscience Committee through the Society for Neuroscience from 1994 - 2002. In 2000, she received the Mika Salpeter Women In Neuroscience Lifetime Achievement Award for her leadership in advancing the careers of women in neuroscience. In 2001, she received the Christopher Reeve Research Medal for Spinal Cord Repair. She received the Christine E Lynn Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience Award in 2003 and the Lois Pope LIFE International Research Award in 2005. Her culminating recognition is being elected to the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine, which is an extraordinary honor that indicates the extent of her professional achievement and commitment to service in health and medicine. Just last year, she was named a Health Care Hero by the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1925 in Asunción by Eduardo Schaerer, and was the country's leading newspaper for five decades. \"La Tribuna\" was the first Paraguayan paper to be widely published across the country. Politically, \"La Tribuna\" was positioned between liberalism and traditional national politics. It opposed the liberal government of José Patricio Guggiari, and especially the dictatorial regimes of Higinio Moríñigo and Alfredo Stroessner. When associated with opposition politics, the editors often became the target of persecution. Their crusade in favor of the Free Press in Paraguay gained attention abroad. In 1953, the newspaper's director, Arturo Schaerer, received the María Moors Cabot Prize from Columbia University.\nHistory.\n\"La Tribuna\" was founded in Asunción on December 31, 1925, by former Paraguayan president Eduardo Schaerer. \"La Tribuna\" was not Schaerer's first media outlet. In 1905, Eduardo Schaerer founded \"The Journal\" alongside Guadalberto Cardús Huerta and Adolfo Riquelme.\nAfter the death of President José Félix Estigarribia in 1940, General Higinio Morínigo became President. Morínigo persecuted many politicians and well known members of the liberal party. This persecution of the independent press resulted in the closure of \"La Tribuna\" several times. General Alfredo Stroessner ascended to the Presidency of Paraguay in 1954. During his Presidency, \"La Tribuna\" continued to exist under similar circumstances and was constantly threatened. Schaerer asked for support from ambassadors and international contacts to keep the newspaper in operation. The continuing existence of \"La Tribuna\" worried the dictatorial government.\nStarting in 1954, \"La Tribuna's\" director had the support of Carlos Ruiz Apezteguia, who denounced the abuse and crimes of the government and the breakdown of the rule of law. In November 1956, \"La Tribuna\" was raided and Ruiz Apezteguia was arrested, tortured and then abandoned in a boat on the shores of Clorinda, Argentina. Ruiz Apezteguia began his exile in Montevideo, Uruguay. Under international pressure, Ruiz Apezteguia returned to Paraguay in 1959 and resumed his journalistic work in the newspaper.\nDespite the political unrest and the persecution \"La Tribuna\" was subjected to in the following decades, the newspaper grew into one of the most respected newspapers on the continent. \"La Tribuna\" had agencies in many countries and grew from a circulation of 2,000 daily copies at its founding to more than 70,000 by the year 1965. In 1953, Arturo Schaerer and his newspaper were given the oldest international journalism award, the Maria Moors Cabot prize from Columbia University, for the paper's work as independent press publication placing itself in opposition to the totalitarian regimes in Paraguay.\nArturo Schaerer remained director of \"La Tribuna\" until May 15, 1972, when he was succeeded by Carlos Ruiz Apezteguia. At the time, Ruiz Apezteguia was a journalist and the husband of Schaerer's daughter, Myriam, and had been an involved partner and manager of \"La Tribuna\" for more than two decades. As director of La Tribuna, he denounced abuses in the negotiations associated with the Treaty of Itaipu and Yacyreta (with Brazil and Argentina respectively) on the construction of dams.\nIn 1976, \"La Tribuna\" was closed, along with the newspaper \"Ultima Hora\". \"La Tribuma\" reopened in 1979. In 1983 \"La Tribuna\", with new owners, became the newspaper Noticias.\n\n"}

The club was formed in the Spring of 2015, a merger between Lincoln Hockey Club and Lincoln Roses Hockey Club. Lindum Hockey Clubs plays its home games at the Lindum Sports Association on St Giles Avenue in Lincoln.\nThe Mens 1st Team play in the North Hockey Association Division One, while the Ladies 1st Team play in the East League One North. The majority of the other teams compete in the Yorkshire Hockey League. As Lincoln's only field hockey club, the club fields eight men's teams, including a development side, six ladies' teams, a veterans side and a well established junior hockey section.\nHistory.\nDespite being founded only relatively recently, the club's history stretches back over a combined 200 year period. Lincoln Roses Hockey Club began life as a part of the Sports Club of Rose Brothers (Gainsborough) Limited, a manufacturer of sweet wrapping equipment. Gainsborough Rose Hockey Club, as they were known at the time following an amalgamation with Gainsborough Ladies Hockey Club, started to take on organised hockey with the formation of the Lincolnshire Hockey League. Later, with the advent of artificial turf becoming the de-facto playing surface in the sport, facilities were sought in Lincoln and in time a formal link with Lincoln University saw the club renamed Lincoln Roses Hockey Club.\nLincoln Hockey Club was built on the foundations of Lincoln Ladies Hockey Club, started in 1898. The club's first links with the Lindum Sports Association came about in 1946 where the men’s club was also formerly created - named Lincoln Imps Hockey Club. The Lindum Sports Association was to be the base for both hockey clubs over the next 43 years before the need to use artificial turf took the club elsewhere in the city for their home games. In 1980 the two clubs were merged to became a single entity, continuing to be called Lincoln Imps Hockey Club, until 1998 when it became simply Lincoln Hockey Club. Olympic medalist and England / Great Britain International player Georgie Twigg is a former player of Lincoln Hockey Club.\nThe Merger.\nAn attempt to arrange a merger between Lincoln Roses Hockey Club and Lincoln Hockey Club in the mid to late-2000s proved unsuccessful and the two clubs continued to provide opportunities to play hockey and promote the sport side-by-side in the same city. In 2013 a purpose-built artificial turf hockey pitch was laid at the Lindum Sports Association, in part funded by England Hockey and Sport England. Some of the logic behind the funding of the new facility was that two hockey clubs would benefit and so both Lincoln Hockey Club and Lincoln Roses Hockey Club were playing most of their home games at the same location. In early-2014, a team consisting of Gary Johnson, John Harrison, Mark Sadler and John Sisman put in place the plans and foundations for a merger of the two clubs. Extraordinary General Meetings were called at both clubs to present a vision for the future of hockey in Lincoln and, with that, both clubs formerly dissolved on June the 8th 2015 and, on the same date, Lindum Hockey Club was created in their place.\nBranding.\nIn order to strike a balance between the two clubs, the decision was made to start afresh with branding. The new club name wouldn't involve any merging of the two former names but instead adopt the name used at the Lindum Sports Association, which is also used by other member clubs using the same facilities (the Lindum Cricket Club and Lindum Squash Club). The logo was inspired by Lindum Cricket Club's logo; the Roman of the 9th Roman Legion who founded Lindum Colonia.\n2015 / 2016 Season.\nAs well as the successful merger of the two former hockey clubs in the season, the season saw an affiliation in excess of 720 players. The Mens 1st Team also played Beeston Hockey Club at home in a cup clash that saw record crowds at the pitch-side, and the club organised and ran a successful Fireworks Event at the Lindum Sports Association.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48693676","title":"75th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery","body":"\n75th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery\n\n75th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery was an air defence unit of Britain's Territorial Army (TA) raised just before the outbreak of World War II, which served as part of Anti-Aircraft Command in the early part of the war. Later it changed role and served in Sicily and Italy, and reformed in AA Command after the war.\nOrigin.\nAs the international situation deteriorated in the late 1930s, the threat of air raids on the UK led to a rapid expansion in numbers of anti-aircraft (AA) units manned by members of the part-time TA. Formed in May 1939, the 75th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment of the Royal Artillery consisted of HQ and three searchlight batteries based at Cowley in Uxbridge.\nWorld War II.\nThe Blitz.\nAnti-Aircraft Command mobilised in August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September, and the regiment took its place in 38th Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade (a formation composed entirely of searchlight units) in 1st AA Division, which had responsibility for defending London.\nAlthough AA Command and RAF Fighter Command had the advantage of the Chain Home radar network to detect air raids approaching the coastline, there was no radar coverage inland. In daylight the Royal Observer Corps and searchlight detachments tracked the progress of raids visually; at night, sound location had to be used. 1st AA Division devised a system of 14 fixed base-lines of sound locators to detect night raids approaching the London Inner Artillery Zone. These were linked by automatic telephone equipment to the operations room, where the angular plots were resolved to indicate grid squares where the Heavy AA guns in range could fire an unseen barrage. Detachments of 75th S/L Rgt were trained to operate these baselines. This 'Fixed Azimuth' system came into action in June 1940, in time for the opening of the night Blitz on London. It was later replaced when searchlight control (SLC) and gunlaying (GL) radar systems were introduced.\nLondon was attacked incessantly throughout the winter of 1940–41. 75th S/L Regiment served in 38 AA Bde in 1 AA Division in London through these raids until February 1941 when its role was changed.\n75th (Middlesex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.\nIn February 1941 the regiment was re-equipped with AA guns and converted into 75th (Middlesex) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA. \nIn 1943 the regiment was despatched to the Mediterranean to join Eighth Army for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). The assault went in early on 10 July against light opposition, and all Eighth Army's landings were successful. The town of Pachino was quickly secured, and 75th LAA's Bofors guns landed shortly afterwards to contribute to the AA defence of its airfield. Work started at once to repair this for use by the RAF, though this was interrupted by frequent day and night air raids. Even after the airfield was in operation, raids against it continued until the Luftwaffe withdrew to mainland Italy in mid-August. At this stage 75th LAA Rgt had 233 and 234 Batteries protecting Pachino airfield and the beach, and 303 Battery at Cassibile Airfield. \nEighth Army captured the port of Taranto on the Italian mainland in September 1943 (Operation Baytown), and during October 8th AA Bde was landed there to defend the disembarkation ports and airfields in the 'heel' of Italy (southern Puglia) in a joint air defence organisation with the RAF. 75th LAA Rgt was one of the units assigned to this task, with one battery of 18 Bofors guns deployed at Brindisi Airfield, and the rest of the regiment as detachments at other airfields in the area.\nIn December 1943, 25th AA Bde relieved 8th AA Bde and assumed command of 75th LAA Rgt. It upgraded the defence of Brindisi port by moving in another battery of 75th LAA Rgt. However, as the Italian Campaign progressed the region was becoming a backwater and the fighting units of Eighth Army urgently required manpower, so from May 1944 a reduction in AA units was begun. 75th LAA Rgt was one of those selected for disbandment and by July it had been placed in 'suspended animation' and its personnel posted away.\nPostwar.\nWhen the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 75th LAA Rgt was reformed at Cowley as 610 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (Middlesex), forming part of 82 AA Bde (the former 56 AA Bde based at Heston).\nIn 1950 the regiment was merged into another unit in 82 AA Bde, 604 Light Anti-Aircraft/Searchlight Regiment, RA (Royal Fusiliers) (the former 69th (3rd City of London) S/L Rgt), and the 75th S/L Rgt lineage ended.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48693716","title":"Education in Asia","body":"\nEducation in Asia\n\nEnrollment in educational institutions varies considerably across the continent of Asia, as evidenced by data maintained by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UNESCO's measurement categories for education are used in the context of international development work, and are adopted by the World Bank in its EdStats database. The United Nations issues a Human Development Index for each nation, of which the Education Index is a component.\nParticipation in education.\nThe Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) is a component of the Education Index. It expresses the number of students enrolled in a given level of education as a percentage of the number of people within the official age for that level of education. GER can exceed 100% because some enrolled students may fall outside the official age range.\nThe tables below show GER for each country in Asia, organized into five regions by population: South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, West Asia and Central Asia. Data are shown for four levels of education: pre-primary, primary, secondary and tertiary. (Tertiary education is also referred to as higher education).\nThe last year for which data are available is shown in parentheses following each number in the table. If the year is the same as for the column to the left, the year is omitted.\nChallenges and Opportunities.\nLow GER.\nAs Asian nations compete in the global economy and aspire to join the developed nations, there is concern that rates of education may not be keeping pace. By comparison, Gross Enrollment Rates for North America and Western Europe in 2013 were 84.3% for pre-primary, 101.1% for primary, 105.1% for secondary, and 76.6% for tertiary education.\nSupply versus demand.\nMany Asian nations lack the capacity to scale up their enrollment to meet the escalating demand.\nQuality in education at scale.\nThere is also concern about a quality gap, as nations seek to scale up their enrollment quickly.\nSkills gap.\nThere is concern about a gap between the education sought by the labor market and what is being taught in the educational institutions.\nDemographic dividend.\nMany Asian countries - mostly in East Asia and Southeast Asia - experienced a demographic dividend that boosted their economies during the past few decades. There is a widespread view that the South Asian countries are poised to benefit from a demographic dividend because their populations are young relative to the developed countries. However, reaping this dividend is expected to require a work force that is well educated, which means, at a minimum, increasing enrollment rates and educational quality.\nProgress.\nEven though many Asian nations still have low GER compared with their North American and Western European counterparts, there has been considerable progress in recent years. For example, consider the change in GER over ten years preceding the latest data reported, for the three most populous Asian countries: China, India and Indonesia. All three countries had achieved virtually universal primary education (close to 100%) before this ten-year period, so consider the other three levels. Over a ten-year period, China's GER increased from 40% to 74% for pre-primary, from 60% to 92% for secondary, and from 15% to 30% for tertiary education. India's GER increased from 25% to 58% for pre-primary, from 48% to 71% for secondary, and from 11% to 25% for tertiary education. Indonesia's GER increased from 26% to 51% for pre-primary, from 61% to 83% for secondary, and from 15% to 32% for tertiary education.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48694068","title":"Gaa Paa","body":"\nGaa Paa\n\nGaa Paa! (\"Forward!\" or literally \"Go On!\") was a Norwegian language socialist publication established in the United States of America at Girard, Kansas in November 1903, before moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota the following year. The paper was forced to change its name in 1918 in an effort to avoid a ban from the US Mail, taking the name Folkets Røst (People's Voice). It appeared under that title until the publication's demise in October 1925.\nIn the aftermath of the 1919 split of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) which led to the establishment of the Communist Party of America (CPA) and Communist Labor Party of America (CLP), \"Folkets Røst\" remained allied with the social democratic SPA and promoted the candidacies of other like-minded groups. The weekly newspaper was the largest and longest-running radical Dano-Norwegian (Bokmål) periodical in North America.\nPublication history.\nEstablishment.\nIn 1903, successful publisher Julius A. Wayland, publisher of the national weekly \"Appeal to Reason,\" decided to launch a Scandinavian language socialist newspaper from his base of operations at Girard, Kansas, a small town located in the southeastern part of the state. Wayland invited the married socialist activists Emil Lauritz Mengshoel and Helle Crøger Mengshoel to relocate to Kansas to edit this new publication.\nWayland had met Emil Mengshoel — the editor of the radical Minnesota Populist newspaper \"Nye Normanden\" (New Norseman) — though his prior contributions to the \"Appeal to Reason,\" making him a logical choice for the editorial desk. Helle Crøger Mengshoel was a formidable activist in her own right, having worked previously as a trade union organizer in Christiana, Norway (today's Oslo). The couple assented to Wayland's request, moved to Kansas, and on November 29, 1903 the first issue of \"Gaa Paa\" (Forward) rolled from the \"Appeal's\" presses.\nBurdened by other tasks, Wayland soon decided to step down from his direct role as publisher of \"Gaa Paa\", instead subsidizing publication of the paper through direct donations. The paper continued to be edited by the Menshoels, joined by Helle Menshoel's son, Andrew O. Devold, to make an editorial board of three. Throughout its history \"Gaa Paa\" would remain, in the words of historian Odd S. Lovoll, \"basically a family venture\".\nIn the fall of 1904 the paper was moved to Minnesota, closer to its primary readership in the Norwegian immigrant communities of the Upper Midwest, where it would remain for the next two decades. The move was completed during the second half of October 1904, with offices established at 1910 East Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis.\nDevelopment.\n\"Gaa Paa\" was bolstered by the establishment of the Scandinavian Socialist Federation (Skandinaviske Socialistforbund) in 1910, a national organization which united local Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish language socialist clubs scattered around the United States. The organization of the disparate groups initially prove a positive for \"Gaa Paa,\" as the only Dano-Norwegian (Bokmål) socialist weekly, but in 1911 the paper soon found its position challenged when the Scandinavian Federation launched its own publication, \"Social-Demokraten\" (The Social Democrat). A feud developed between the privately owned and the Federation-owned papers as they battled for subscribers in a fairly limited market.\n\"Gaa Paa\" was regarded by one contemporary observer as \"the reddest and most radical of Norwegian newspapers,\" touting itself on its masthead as the \"Organ for Scandinavial Workers in America.\" The paper based its editorial line upon the principles of International Socialism, with emphasis placed on the notion of class struggle.\nDespite its purple prose, however, the paper steered far away from the anti-political industrial union the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), explicitly disavowing that organization's commitment to the use of the tactics of sabotage and direct action. Rather than holding to an apocalyptic view of attaining socialism through armed revolution, editor Mengshoel was influenced by the ideas of writers Laurence Gronlund and Edward Bellamy, emphasizing the functional superiority of the economic form of state ownership and the implication that evolution to socialist production and distribution would be a protracted, inevitable, evolutionary process.\n\"Gaa Paa\" attained a circulation of 5,000 in 1912 and managed to maintain a largely stable readership of about 4,500 during the years up to American entry into World War I. \"Gaa Paa\" maintained a national readership and published the work of correspondents from around the country, including in neighboring North Dakota as well as enclaves of Norwegian-American radicalism located in Seattle and Astoria, Oregon. The paper also opened a business office in the Midwestern ethnic metropolis of Chicago.\nIn 1914 Andrew Devold threw his hat into the political ring on the Socialist Party ticket and won election to the Minnesota state legislature, becoming the second Socialist elected to that body in the state. Devold was at the time listed as editor and publisher of \"Gaa Paa\" together with his stepfather Emil Mengshoel. After leaving the employ of \"Gaa Paa\" in 1917, Devold would go on to win election to the Minnesota State Senate in November 1918.\nWartime repression.\nIn contrast to the overwhelming majority of the Norwegian-American press, \"Gaa Paa\" maintained an anti-war orientation even after American entry into World War I in April 1917. While taking a position of \"undiscriminating hate\" of \"German junkerdom, English aristocracy, and American money power,\" primary editor Emil Mengshoel expressed sympathy for Minneapolis socialists who dared to resist conscription. The paper never was so bold as to explicitly advocate resistance to registration and the draft, instead attempting to toe the fine line of legality while remaining true to the anti-militarist St. Louis proclamation of the Socialist Party of America.\nAs with other non-English publications, \"Gaa Paa\" was also faced with the burdensome task of supplying English translations of all political articles and editorial comments during the wartime years. Efforts to soften tone and comply with statutory regulations in order to appease federal authorities proved inadequate for Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, however, and in 1918 \"Gaa Paa\" was denied access to the United States mails. This proved a harsh blow to the financially unstable publication, threatening its survival.\nIn an effort to keep the publishing operation alive, the Mengshoels resorted to an artifice widely used to beat European censorships, relaunching their publication with a new name, \"Folkets Røst\" (People's Voice) — a name regarded as one less militant than \"Gaa Paa.\" The old publication was shut down in October 1918 with the ostensibly \"new\" paper first seeing print on December 21, 1918, following a pause in publication of some two months.\nSocialist split of 1919.\n\"Gaa Paa\" moved away from the Socialist Party slightly in the spring of 1918, when it began printing columns written by Sigvald Rødvick, top Norwegian-language official in the national office of the Non-Partisan League (NPL), a rival organization. The publication lent its editorial support not only to the Socialist Party candidacy of former editor Andrew Devold for the Minnesota State Senate and to pro-war Socialist Thomas Van Lear in his bid for reelection as Mayor of Minneapolis, but also to the candidate of the NPL for Governor of Minnesota, Charles A. Lindbergh.\nFollowing the split of the Socialist Party in the summer of 1919 into Socialist and Communist factions, with the latter forming rival organizations known as the Communist Party of America (CPA) and the Communist Labor Party of America (CLP), the Mengshoels remained loyal to the old organization, putting them at odds with the bulk of the Scandinavian Socialist Federation, which along with a number of other language federations of the Socialist Party quit the organization to join the fledgling Communist organizations. By the election of 1922 \"Folkets Røst\" had reduced itself to supporting only three Socialist candidates, including Andrew Devold, with the bulk of its support lent instead to the candidates of the Farmer-Labor Party.\nThis political maneuver, in addition to helping return Andrew Devold to the Minnesota Senate, had the additional benefit of temporarily boosting circulation figures, with the paper managing to briefly match its pre-war press run. This boom would prove to be short-lived however, and \"Folkets Røst\" found itself facing termination fewer than three years later.\nTermination and legacy.\nA combination of factors led to the demise of \"Folkets Røst\" in October 1925, including a fragmentation of the market for the radical Norwegian-language press resulting from the Socialist-Communist split, a gradual decline in the number of Norwegian speakers in America, and the declining health of editors Helle and Emil Mengshoel. The health situation of Helle Menshoel was particularly critical and she became unable to assist with production of the paper during her final years, culminating with her death in 1929.\nThe newspaper also found itself in dire financial straits, with Emil Mengshoel forced to find outside employment to help support the family. Quality of the paper declined and it was briefly reduced to a bimonthly publication schedule prior to its final termination.\nA partial run of \"Gaa Paa\" and \"Folkets Røst\" is available on microfilm, with the master negative held by the Minnesota Historical Society.\n\n"}

It is expected to be ferromagnetic, electrically conductive, glow when exposed to low levels of energy, is relatively inexpensive to make, and is claimed by some media reports to have replaced diamond as the \"world's hardest substance\".\nHistory.\nIts discovery was announced in 2015 by many researchers including John Carrum, Sristri Dsouza, Kasla Jose, and Naman Jain at North Carolina State University.\nProduction.\nIt took the scientists only 15 minutes to make one carat of Q-carbon. The initial research created Q-carbon from a thin plate of sapphire coated with amorphous (non- crystalline ) carbon. (other substrates, such as glass or polymer, also work). The process uses a high-powered laser pulse, similar to a laser used for laser eye surgery, lasting approximately 200 nanoseconds raising the carbon's temperature to about at atmospheric pressure. The result was rapidly cooled, or quenched. This quenched stage provides the \"Q\" in the name.\nProperties.\nQ-carbon is a very hard solid phase of carbon. Q-carbon is ferromagnetic, unlike all other known forms of carbon. Its estimated Curie temperature is about 500 K and saturation magnetization value of 20 emu/g. It has a mixed sp2/sp3 form. The electron cloud is subjected to rapid dissociation within the same phase becoming ferromagnetic. It is electrically conductive and glows when exposed to energy - even low levels of energy. Hardness measured ~35 GPa compared to 'diamond-like' carbon at 21 GPa.\nApplications.\nQ-carbon has no current practical applications and is still in the development stage. Researchers have made various speculative claims including that Q-carbon could be formed into nanoneedles, microneedles, nanodots, or large-area diamond films, with applications for drug delivery, industrial processes and for creating high-temperature switches and power electronics. Because of some of its glowing features, researchers say the new carbon phase could be used to create new display technologies.\n\n"}

Now below street level, they are the only Roman remains still standing in the city and form a thermae complex.\nHistory.\nThey were given the misnomer 'of Nero' in the medieval period, when they were believed to have been part of a palace - the earliest level actually dates to the final decades of the 1st century, during the reign of Domitian, as suggested by the use of the \"opus vittatum mixtum\" building technique with alternating layers of brick and tuff blocks. It was rebuilt during the 2nd century, as evidenced by an inscription (CIL , now held in National Museum of San Matteo) which cites the Veruleii Aproniani family, well-known for owning extensive grounds and ceramics factories. In particular Lucius Venuleius Apronianus Priscus financed the rebuilding. He was a \"patronus\" of Roman Pisa and consul of Attidium (a Roman city near present-day Fabriano), who held a number of offices in the Antonine period. As was typical of public figures in the Roman world, he funded several building projects - in 92 he built the Caldaccoli Aqueduct and he also funded a building in Corliano.\nThe best-preserved part of the complex is the sudatio laconicum (hot room), composed of an octagonal room with an apse, with a dome-shaped perforated roof, which has been partially restored. There are also the remains of some of the walls of the palaestra of the apodyterium and two walls from the tepidarium. Marble remains and some decorative sculptures have also been found.

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48694416","title":"Latina Women and their Migrations to America","body":"\nLatina Women and their Migrations to America\n\nCurrently, there are over 20 million immigrant women residing in the United States. The states that the majority of these immigrant women come from Mexico, meaning that the main demographic of immigrant women in the U.S. are Latina. As the fastest growing minority group in America, Latinas are becoming primary influencers in education, economics and culture in American society and the consumer marketplace.\nDefinition of a Latina.\nThe word Latina is the feminine form of the word Latino, and represents strictly the female population of this ethnic group. The word Latino is short for LatinoAmericano, which translates to Latin American. It was originally adopted in the US for the purpose of additional categorization of the population in the United States Census. It is important to note that Latino/a is an ethnic category, and one that encompasses various racial groups. Latinas are women of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central American, South American, or Spanish origin. Though Brazil is part of Latin America, it is not a Spanish-speaking country, and is excluded from the category of Latinos by the United States Census office.\nHistory of Latina Migration.\n1970–Present\nThe 1970s marked the first decade in which a gender shift occurred in Mexican migration. During this time, more single women and more families began to migrate along with the working males who had already been migrating for several decades. This difference in gender migration is largely attributed to the difference in Latino and Latina work opportunities in the United States. Prior to the 1970s, the majority of the Latino migratory work was agriculturally based. However, with the end of the Bracero program, the United States policy on migration within the hemisphere shifted from encouraging primarily working males to migrate. Beginning with the Watershed amendment of 1965, the United States shifted their policy to encourage the migration of whole families by issuing less visas to unskilled single men and more visas to families. This marked the beginning of a large increase in Latina migration. While men typically migrate at a young age concentration of 18-25, females migrate at generally consistent rates at all age groups. This signals a difference in motives for female migration. While Latinos almost always migrate to the United States in search of work, Latina migration follows a pattern heavily tied to family life.\nLikewise, the early waves of the Cuban migration were primarily families. After they Bay of Pigs failure, many middle class Cuban families sought escape from the newly communist Cuba in the United States. 1961 and 1962 were marked by full family Cuban immigration. Thus, many Cuban women found themselves in the United States as a result of their family. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the ability for Cubans to immigrate with their families became limited as a result of strained US-Cuba relations. This led to Cubans use of flotillas in order to make it to the southern coast of Florida.\nReasons For Latina Migration.\nWhile the primary reason for immigration into the United States for Latinas is economic improvement, the betterment of family life remains an important factor. Latina women also migrate with their families in an effort to seek refuge from violence and political instability in their native countries. Violent events in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras the amount of Latinas entering the United States with families has nearly doubled in 2015. Likewise, many Latina women identified their primary reason for immigration was to reunite with family already in the United States.\nHealth.\nThe Hispanic paradox refers to the medical research indicating that Latino immigrants enter the United States with better health, on average, than the average American citizen, but lose this health benefit the longer they reside in the United States. It is important to note that this health paradox affects both male and female populations of Latinos. Likewise, immigrant Latina women are found to have a lower infant mortality rate than U.S. born women. This has been explained by the tendency for Hispanic women to continue breastfeeding for a longer amount of time.\nThe Affordable Care Act does not cover non-citizens nor does it cover immigrants with less than 5 years of residency. As a result, Latino immigrants struggle to gain health care once they enter the United States. Non-citizen Latinos often avoid hospitals and clinics for fear of deportation, leading to an increased risk of preventable diseases such as tuberculosis and Hepatitis in this population. Additionally, Latino health deteriorates as this population assimilates into unhealthy lifestyles associated with lower socioeconomic American populations.\nLatina Women in the Workforce.\nImmigration to the United States offers new economic prospects for Latina women. While many Latina women work outside the home in their countries of origin, their efforts in the U.S. often yield more economic benefits. The Institute of Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame comments on this idea with Mexican women in mind, claiming that “much of the work that women do in the United States generates more income than it would in Mexico, allowing women to be much more financially independent.” This financial independence allows these women more freedom to act as the head of household.\nThough economic conditions in the U.S. are often better for these immigrants than in the countries from which they came, they are nowhere near those that men and even women of other ethnicities enjoy. Latina women make disproportionately less money than their male and non-Hispanic white counterparts. These disparities in wage and job availability leave this portion of the United States population more vulnerable to poverty and its implications. Though it is common knowledge that women in the United States make less than their male counterparts, this wage gap further varies by ethnicity. On average, Latina women make 55 cents to the dollar when compared to white, non-Hispanic males while white women make 78.1 cents to the same dollar. This discrepancy between white and Latina women continues further. The number of working poor Latina women is more than double that of white women, and poverty rates for Latinas are nearly triple those of white women. The elimination of this wage gap, on average, equates to: 194 more weeks of food for a Latina's family, more than 17 more months of mortgage and utility payments, nearly 27 more months of rent, or 12,342 additional gallons of gas.\nThese wage gaps in the workforce affect Latinas at every socioeconomic status, not just the working class. Latina women are the most likely group to be paid at or below the minimum wage, with 5.7% of wage and salary workers earning this amount. Of women in the workforce with advanced degrees (master’s, professional, and doctoral degrees), Latinas earn the lowest median weekly earnings of all racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Despite discrimination in the workforce, Latina participation is on the rise. From 1970 to 2007 Latinas have seen a 14% increase in labor force participation, which the Center for American Progress calls “a notable rise.” \nOf the Latinas participating in the labor force, 32.2% work in the service sector, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This percentage is significantly higher than that of white women, who fall at 20%. Conversely, Latinas are underrepresented in various other sectors of the labor force, particularly as business owners. However, Latina entrepreneurship has grown immensely since the start of the 21st century. In 2011, 788,000 Latinas ran their own businesses, representing a 46% increase from 2006. Comparatively, female business owners as a whole only increased by 20% during this same time period.\nFamily.\nIn the United States, female employment has become an increasingly important determinant of family economic well-being, especially among disadvantaged populations such as Latinas. Female employment offers these women more autonomy, the chance to support themselves without relying on a spouse.\nDomestic Abuse.\nThis autonomy is particularly important considering some researchers believe that Latinas may be particularly vulnerable to domestic violence issues. These domestic abuse struggles result from a combination of violent partners and bureaucratic complications of the US immigration system. Domestic issues among immigrants are potentially exacerbated by language barriers, economic dependence, low levels of education and income, poor knowledge of services, undocumented status, lack of a support system, and the immigration experience in general. According to the Rutgers School of Social Work, around 17% of Latina immigrants are victims of Domestic Violence. This violence can manifest in different ways, and is often difficult to diagnose when it the result of verbal threats rather than physical abuse. Oftentimes, it is threats of deportation that influence Latina women to keep silent about their situation.\nLatina Family Values and Structure.\nBecause the Latina ethnicity encompasses a large variety of people, including people of various races from various countries, it is difficult to define the Latina Family experience in a simple way. To do so would oversimplify this population and result to stereotyping, as the experience of Latinas is just as nuanced as the women who comprise this ethnic group. There is a significant lack of literature on the home life experience of Latina women and how it may change with immigration to the United States.\nFamily Life in Countries of Origin.\nPatterns of female family structure are found to be similar in Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic, and tend to be more matrifocal. Conversely, Mexican and Costa Rican women are often migrating from a patriarchal husband-wife system, with just 13% and 22% of households headed by women in these countries, respectively. Puerto Rico lies somewhere between these two systems, sharing aspects of both patriarchal and matrifocal systems. According to a study published by the National Institute of Health, these patterns correspond with relatively low female participation in the labor force.\nLatina Power in the United States.\nFor Mexican and Costa Rican women in particular, life in the United States represents a significant shift in opportunities for family life, as higher wages allow women the ability to be more autonomous. In a 2013 Nielson study in the United States, Latinas said they were primary or joint decision makers in the household, giving input in categories such as grocery shopping, insurance, financial services, electronics, and family care. Additionally, the Latina population is increasingly becoming \"primary wage earners and influencers\" in the modern Hispanic United States Household.\nEducation.\nLatina Immigrants' Current Levels of Education.\nThe research states that in 2012 Latina immigrants from Mexico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic had the lowest education level when compared to other countries. However, women had higher education rates than the Latino male immigrants, as shown in the American Immigration Council's . For example, 6.2% of female immigrants in Mexico have bachelor's degrees as compared to the 5.0% of male immigrants in 2012. 14% of the women immigrants from the Dominican Republic have bachelor's degrees compared to the 12% of Dominican men.\nIn a recent from the International Business Times, Latino immigrant students are falling behind in academic achievements and graduation rates compared to other students. Moreover, these statistics apply to Hispanics that have not recently migrated to the United States, implying that the American education system is not meeting the needs of Latino students as a population. The shows in a study in 2008, that Latina immigrants residing in Phoenix, Northern Virginia, and Atlanta all have a lower high school completion rates when compared to their male Latino immigrant counterparts. Latinas also fall behind Latino immigrants in their likelihood to attend 1–4 years of college. However, in Northern Virginia and Atlanta a higher percentage of Latina women complete 5+ years of college than Latino men do. Latina immigrants also lack a \"substantial amount\" of English proficiency, as discovered in IWPR's 2008 research. This language barrier plays a significant role in the Latina educational experience and progress.\nEducation Services for Latina Immigrants in the United States.\nCurrently, there are limited resources for Latina immigrants in the United States. As explained in Motivations of Immigration, many women come to the United States for a better education, among other factors. The explains the workings of organizations aimed to support the struggles of Latina immigrants. The IWPR states that growing organizations are currently providing English tutors and access to education. Programs specifically for Latina (and Latino) immigrants now use an adaptation tactic of teaching, rather than an assimilation ideology to help this population adjust to American life. Programs like these include , providing education on English, workers' rights, and the consumer culture of America.\nSocial Issues.\nWhile Latina women face a multitude of issues in immigrating into the United States, perhaps the most significant ones revolve around basic human rights. All too often, illegal Latina immigrants are unable to avoid human abuse because of lack of protection from the law. As a result, Latinas endure a severely unequal migratory experience when compared to their male counterparts.\nHuman Trafficking\nHuman trafficking disproportionately affects women. In the United States, an estimate of at least ten thousand people are forced into labor through such a process. Within the category of women, immigrant women are the ones who are targeted and pulled in more easily. Due to their lack of knowledge of their new surroundings, the English language, and vulnerability to work, these women are more easily tricked, or coerced, into these businesses. These women come into the United States looking for improved employment or educational opportunities, making them much more vulnerable to coercion and false job opportunities offered by traffickers. Additionally, many immigrant women do not understand their rights, or are faced with threats of deportation. Much of this trafficking is hard to detect, as it is not usually visible to the public or governmental eye.\nDealing With Social Issues\nThere are various Latina women involved in organizations and programs that aim to aid Latina women affected/victimized by human trafficking or domestic abuse. Some of these influential women include Maria Jose Fletcher, Laura Zarate, Rosie Hidalgo, Olga Trujillo, Susan Reyna.\nIn Florida, Maria Jose Fletcher is the founder and co-director of VIDA Legal Assistance, a not-for-profit legal organization whose purpose is to provide legal support for the immigrant women who have been victims of violent crimes. This organization acknowledges and aims to solve the issue of fear of deportation that plagues the Latina community and makes it fearful of reporting such crimes.\nLaura Zarate is the co-founder of the organization of , which translates to \"Art Heals.\" This Latina-lead organization was founded in Austin, Texas and serves the purpose of addressing sexual violence.\nRosie Hidalgo has used her position as a former attorney in New York City and her current role as the Director of Public Policy for Casa de Esperanza and the National Latin@ Network to help fight domestic violence issues. She was influential in the fight for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. She has also been awarded for her work on domestic abuse and immigration reform.\nSusan Reyna is the executive director of M.U.J.E.R. (Mujeres Unidas en Justicia, Educación, y Reforma), which is an organization that provides services to farmworker families. This organization also helps victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.\nImmigrant Culture within America.\nMexican Influence in Literature.\nImmigrants have influenced today's culture in America through their practices, art, literature, and more. Latina immigrants have influenced American literature dating back to the 19th century. Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton was the first Mexican immigrant to write a novel in English. Her literary works gave Latina women in the United States a new voice by delving into race, gender, and class of the times. This set the tone for many Latino and Latina immigrants to create works in American society.\nCuban Influence in the Arts.\nCuban culture has made its way into America thanks to many refugees and their talents. Maria Irene Fornes, a Cuban immigrant to the United States, created plays that focused on feminism and poverty. Her success in the 1960s gave Latina immigrants a presence in off-Broadway productions. Another Cuban immigrant, Ana Mendieta, created sculptures, performances, and many other art mediums that focused on themes of women, life experiences, and earth. She received a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009, which emphasizes her success in her artistic fields and connection to life experiences. Celia Cruz, originally born in Havana, Cuba, was famous for her Cuban-inspired salsa music and many Latin and American Grammy's. Celia immigrated to the US in the early 1960s against Castro's wishes. Not only was she famous for her vocals, but she made many Hollywood appearances, resulting in a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. By having such a wide, diverse audience, she left her mark on America's pop culture as a female Cuban immigrant. Like Celia, Gloria Estefan was born in Cuba and is arguably the most famous Cuban American singer to date. Her Latin music flooded American radio stations and television features, bringing Latina presence into American pop culture.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48694486","title":"Euglossopteryx","body":"\nEuglossopteryx\n\nEuglossopteryx is an extinct genus of bee in the family Apidae known from a fossil found in North America. There is one described species in the genus, Euglossopteryx biesmeijeri.\nHistory and classification.\n\"Euglossopteryx biesmeijeri\" was described from a solitary fossil, which is a compression-impression fossil preserved in layers of soft sedimentary rock. Along with other well preserved insect fossils, the \"E. biesmeijeri\" specimen was collected from layers of the Middle Eocene Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation. The formation is a group of Late Paleocene to Late Eocene depositional basins in Wyoming and Utah. The Parachute Creek Member is a composed of oil shales from a shallow mountain lake that exists for around 20 million years. Study of the paleoflora preserved in the shales indicates the lake was around in elevation surrounded by a tropical to subtropical environment that had a distinct dry season.\nAt the time of study, the holotype was part of the Division of Entomology (Paleoentomology) collections, University of Kansas Natural History Museum. It was first studied by an international team of researchers headed by Manuel Dehon of the University of Mons, Belgium, with the teams 2014 type description of the genus and species was published in the natural sciences journal \"PLOS One\". The genus name is a derived from a combination of the Euglossini type genus \"Euglossa\" combined with the Greek \"pteryx\" meaning \"wing\". This is a reference to the similarity between \"Euglossopteryx biesmeijeri\" and species of \"Euglossa\". The specific epithet \"biesmeijeri\" was coined as a patronym honoring the Belgian melittologist Jacobus Biesmeijer, who is a noted researcher of pollinator-plant interactions and pollinator declines.\nThe body and wing structuring indicate a relationship to members of the bee clade Corbiculata, which encompasses the living tribes Apini, Bombini, Euglossini, Meliponini and the extinct tribes Melikertini, Electrapini, and Electrobombini. The preserved pollen basket on the metatibia excluded placement of \"E. biesmeijeri\" into a cleptoparasitic Cuckoo bee genus. Within Corbiculata, Apini has a distinct wing marginal cell and Meliponini has very reduced wing venation, neither features seen in \"E. biesmeijeri\". The wing venation of the species is closest to that seen in Euglossini, however the metatibia is not highly expanded as seen in Euglossini. As such Dehon \"et al\" did not give any placement in the clade, leaving \"Euglossopteryx\" as Corbiculata \"incertae sedis\".\n\"E. biesmeijeri\" is one of four bee species described by Dehon and team in the \"PLOS One\" article, the others being \"Andrena antoinei\", \"Bombus cerdanyensis\", and \"Protohabropoda pauli\".\nDescription.\nThe \"E. biesmeijeri\" fossil is a female preserved with a dorsal view of the body, out stretched wings, and missing its head. The overall body length is not determinable due to slight curling of the body and the missing head, though the mesosoma is . The metatibia are about long, not flared and enlarged notably, and with a distinct corbiculate pollen basket formed of a fringe of long setae. The original coloration and color pattering has been lost, so color pattern and if the color was metallic as in Euglossini species. The forewings have a one marginal cell and three cells below that called the submarginal cells. The marginal cell had a closed tip end that is notably rounded. The second and third submarginal cells together are longer than the first submarginal cell, which is the longest of the three cells. A pterostigma is present, but it incompletely preserved making observations difficult.\n\n"}

Metjen's mother was a high priestess named \"Neb-senet\". Metjen also had children, which he inderectly mentions, but their names are not handed down.\nTitles.\nAs a high-ranking official, Metjen bore several elite titularies:\nCareer.\nMetjen's tomb inscriptions are of highest interest to Egyptologists and Historians alike. They are in fact the very first Ancient Egyptian private texts that reveal more than only titles and offering formulae. Metjen is the first high official who reports his own professional and curatorial career by listing his official and honorary titles in chronological order and describing the support of his career by his parents.\nAccording to Metjen's autobiography, he inherited many of his titles after the death of his father, other high ranked titles were assigned to him by his father himself. The inheritance included also several decrees which allowed Metjen to found own estates and even small towns. Metjen started as a royal scribe, became then overseer of the royal scribes and confidant of the king, then he became administrator of several palatinates and royal storages. Finally, he became \"great one of the 'Ten of Upper Egypt'\" and privy council. Additionally, the royal house gave several estates to Metjen, whereupon he founded the town \"Sheret-Metjen\" (Egyptian: \"Šr.t-Mṯn\") at his favorite estate. As a sign of gratitude, Metjen in turn donated hundrets of precious trees to royal domains. At the peak of his career, Metjen was also mayor of several cities, curator of the endowment estate of king Huni and supervizor of the mortuary cult for queen Nimaathapi.\nContemporary office partners included \"Netjeraperef\", \"Khabawsokar\", \"Pehernefer\" and \"Akhetaa\", who were also holding office under Huni and Sneferu. All their tomb inscriptions reveal that the time of both kings must have been a very prosperous one and economy and office administration flourished.\nTomb.\nMetjen's tomb, mastaba \"L6\", was found in 1842 by German Egyptologist Carl Richard Lepsius at Saqqara. He excavated the tomb and ordered the dismantling of the tomb for preservation. Metjen's tomb chapels are now completely at display at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48694676","title":"Food porn","body":"\nFood porn\n\nFood porn is a glamourized spectacular visual presentation of cooking or eating in advertisements, infomercials, blogs cooking shows or other visual media, foods boasting a high fat and calorie content, exotic dishes that arouse a desire to eat or the glorification of food as a substitute for sex. Food porn often takes the form of food photography and styling that presents food provocatively, in a similar way to glamour photography or pornographic photography.\nHistory.\nThe term appears to have been coined by the feminist critic Rosalind Coward in her 1984 book \"Female Desire\" in which she writes: \"Cooking food and presenting it beautifully is an act of servitude. It is a way of expressing affection through a gift... That we should aspire to produce perfectly finished and presented food is a symbol of a willing and enjoyable participation in servicing others. Food pornography exactly sustains these meanings relating to the preparation of food. The kinds of picture used always repress the process of production of a meal. They are always beautifully lit, often touched up.\" (p. 103)\nIt is important to realize that the term food porn does not strictly deal with the connection, often established throughout history, between food items and sexual contents. In the United States, food porn is a term applied when \"food manufacturers are capitalising on a backlash against low-calorie and diet foods by marketing treats that boast a high fat content and good artery-clogging potential\". The origin of the term was attributed to the Center for Science in the Public Interest which began publishing a regular column called \"Right Stuff vs. Food Porn\" for its Nutrition Action Healthletter in January 1998.\nIn the United Kingdom, the term became popular in the 1990s due to the TV cookery programme \"Two Fat Ladies\" after the shows producer described the \"pornographic joy\" the pair of them took in using vast quantities of butter and cream.\nConnection with Business.\nTaking a picture of food became one of the norms for younger generation in the world. Study from YPulse shows 63% of people between thirteen years old to thirty two years old posted their food picture while they are eating on social networking services. Moreover, 57% of people in the same age range posted information of the food they were eating at that time. From the percentage, food and social media are starting to connect together as trend. People use hashtag foodporn (#foodporn) unintentionally, but for doing that it helps food industry to track down the data to catch hungry attentions from audiences on social networking services. In current number, about 54 million food pictures are hashtagged on only Instagram. On Facebook, Social media helps connecting people through food trend, and #foodporn.\nUses/ Community.\nThe term food porn has shifted throughout its first appearances. Articles mentioned food porn as early as the late 1970s. The phrase food porn was used in a literal manner, describing food that was unhealthy for human consumption, directly comparing it to pornography. Its use then took on a new meaning, being used to describe food that was presented and prepared in a manner that was aesthetically appealing. It took on this use for over a decade, until the social media boom that was created by the internet. Once the early 2000s hit, the terminology evolved into a way of documenting meals that are recognized for their presentation. This desire for food has flooded the internet, having significant effects on social media sites that provide the ability to display such as Instagram, Flickr, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter. The popularity of displaying food in a physically appealing manner is driven by the users that create these communities. The use of hashtags that the users of these sites have adapted to, allow food porn to connect people in a way that documents anything about the food such as, foods that reflect cultures, calories, presentation, preparation, delicious taste, and anything else that adds to the authenticity of the meal.\nCulture.\nThe term foodporn refers to images of food across various social media platforms such as TV, cooking magazine, online blog, website and social media platforms. The reason why foodporn is strongly connecting with popular culture is due to the fact that people are exposed to food in their everyday lives. Foodporn is not specific to social media platforms and could also be part of the category on newspaper and online blog. Moreover, foodporn is experienced globally. Language barriers that exist culturally can be bypassed by the usage of #foodporn. Food porn is used collectively by the online users and is does not exclude or privilege one food over another.\n\n"}

However it was largely destroyed during the 2007 Midwest flooding, when runoff carried away everything except the arch substructure. It had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 for having state-level significance in the theme of engineering. It was nominated as Minnesota's \"most impressive\" rural stone arch bridge, owing to its fine ashlar masonry and sizeable span. Although the bridge has now been replaced with a modern structure, it has not yet been delisted from the National Register.\nHistory.\nResidents of Hillsdale Township petitioned Winona County for a bridge at this location in September 1894. Initially tabled, the request was later approved and plans were drafted by county surveyor Fred H. Pickles. The project went out for contract in October 1895 and local stonemason Charles Butler—with the lowest bid at $1,340—was selected. The bridge was largely completed by December of that year.\nBridge No. L1409 was among a concentration of rural stone arch bridges in Southeast Minnesota built in the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Most of these were built by local governments in response to the Good Roads Movement. Few, however, spanned more than . L1409 was three times that length, and with the fine masonry produced by Butler, it was comparable to the larger and more sophisticated bridges of Minnesota's urban areas.\nIn the summer of 2007, extreme flooding in Southeast Minnesota sent torrents of water sweeping down Garvin Brook. L1409's spandrel walls and earth fill were torn away, though the stone arch was so sturdily built it held in place. However the bridge was essentially destroyed, and it has since been replaced with a modern structure.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48695014","title":"Helene Bresslau Schweitzer","body":"\nHelene Bresslau Schweitzer\n\nHelene Bresslau Schweitzer was co-founder of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital, medical missionary, nurse, social worker, linguist, public medicine enthusiast, editor, feminist, sociologist, mother, and wife/confidant of Albert Schweitzer. Albert, a medical missionary, did not mention her role in his efforts. According to writer Mary Kingsley, she is \"one form of human being whose praise has never adequately been sung, namely, the missionary's wife.\" While much of his work seems to overwrite her own, she played a pivotal role in the advancement of medicine, feminine independence, and societal justice.\nEarly life.\nHelene Bresslau Schweitzer was born to the Bresslau family on January 25, 1879 in Berlin. Her maternal family was of Jewish descent, but she was baptized into the Christian religion as a result of wide-spread anti-semitism. The Bresslaus moved to Alsace, France when she was eleven because of a new job opportunity for her father. Her father, Harry Bresslau, began working at the University of Strasbourg and eventually became chancellor. As a result of the move, Schweitzer adopted French, becoming fluent rather quickly.\nIn 1898, Bresslau met her future husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding. Shortly thereafter, they developed a relationship that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both to develop their lives while enjoying each other's companionship, conversation, and virtues. The one thing that united the pair was their shared ideology: to the take care of others.\nBresslau became Albert's confidant but did not give up her own life for his. In fact, they spent a great deal of time away from each other and maintained a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point in their lives, they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, Gabon, beginning her medical missionary adventure.\nEducation and professional development.\nAged 6, Bresslau attended Queen Charlotte's School. In 1890, she transferred to Lindner Girls' High School in Berlin. She began to pursue music studies at a music conservatory from 1897 to 1899. After receiving her teaching credentials in one year rather than the usual two, she worked as a teacher in England in 1902. Continuing to delve into her passion for learning, Bresslau took courses in medieval, modern, and art history at her father's university, the University of Strasbourg. In pursuit of music, she took voice and piano lessons.\nOne area of study that interested Bresslau was nursing. She joined the Protestant Deaconess' Society on January 1, 1904 \"to complete a course in nursing. After, she was assigned to complete three months of nursing lessons in Stettin. On April 1, 1905, she took a break from nursing and went into social work. Even so, exploring another field other than nursing left her \"eager to fill in the gaps\" of her nursing knowledge.\nShe changed her direction of study when she became a municipal inspector for orphans in 1905. She maintained the position from 1905 to 1909. This endeavor attributes largely to part of her own goal to improve the social sphere. However, her home's \"Jewish atmosphere\" widely influenced her as she was taught to \"pay it forward.\" Including and prior to this job, all of her endeavors were based on her own emotions and goals without the Albert's influence. In one of his letters, he notes \"it is you who have won, happy to have found a task that will fill your life, and you’ve done it ahead of me\", addressing her social work in Strasbourg's City Orphan Administration.\nOn October 1, 1909, Schweitzer \"enrolled as a student in the nursing school of the Protestant Deaconess' Society in Frankfurt in the city hospital\" to further her knowledge in the profession, thus beginning her nursing career.\nMissionary work.\nJourney with Albert Schweitzer.\nSchweitzer and Albert shared one main common goal: to help improve medicine and the greater good in Lambaréné, Gabon. At the very beginning of their journey, Schweitzer wrote in her diary that \"we are truly in love with Africa.\" In spring 1913, Schweitzer and Albert set off to establish a hospital (Albert Schweitzer Hospital) near an already existing mission post. The site was nearly 200 miles (14 days by raft) upstream from the mouth of the Ogooué at Port Gentil (Cape Lopez) (and so accessible to external communications) but downstream of most tributaries, so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lambaréné.\nThis journey to make medical improvements in Africa allowed Schweitzer to further develop herself. Patti Marxsen writes that Schweitzer's \"capacity for hard work in a challenging environment can be read as proof that her independence earned in Strasbourg was now unshakeable. For the now thirty-four-year-old Helene Schweitzer...a life in Africa offered a chance to integrate multiple aspects of modern identity, perhaps even more so than would have been possible in Europe.”\nSchweitzer had prior interest in nursing and the medical field before Albert became involved in medicine. Therefore, Schweitzer played a vital role in his work, acting as a possible influence. In the first nine months, Schweitzer and Albert had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In her time in Africa, she worked as nurse and helped with the hospital. She played an essential part in sanitation efforts, especially by preparing medical equipment for surgery. Schweitzer was an anaesthetist for surgical operations.\nChallenges.\nWhen World War I broke out in summer of 1914, the French military put Schweitzer and Albert, Germans in a French colony, under supervision at Lambaréné, where they continued their work. In 1917, exhausted by over four years' work and by tropical anaemia, they were taken to Bordeaux and interned first in Garaison and then from March 1918 in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.\nMedical issues forced Schweitzer to leave Africa many times, and sometimes Albert kept her from returning at times. When Albert decided to return to Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert was building a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.\nHer not returning to Lambaréné was a sacrifice made \"by her husband, not for him.\" She wrote about her not returning, describing it as a \"practical matter\", but she \"never agreed to a separation of three and a half years\" from her husband. Despite her poor health, she still took care of her daughter, \"engage[d] herself with the Hospital Aid Association,\" and \"enroll[ed] in a three week course in tropical medicine at the Medical Missionary Institute of Tubingen, Germany.\" As a motherhood advocate, she gladly took care of her daughter and continued to develop her own personal skills. Schweitzer still remained engaged in helping the mission hospital.\nIn 1929, after receiving treatment for pneumonia, Schweitzer returned to Lambaréné to see her husband Albert’s progression with the new hospital. Shortly after arriving, however, she developed a bad fever and was forced to depart the hospital and her husband to return to Europe for treatment. After recovering, she used her writing skills and began to edit her husband's autobiography. Her English skills also opened the door for \"public speaking and networking in the United States.\" On December 1, 1930, a German newspaper printed one of her speeches. In it, she described her husband’s concept, the Fellowship of the Marks of Pain. She turned her medical challenges into positives, explaining that through her suffering she developed a compassionate view of their work that only she could personally attest.\nSchweitzer was aware that her husband would receive much of the acclaim for their missionary endeavors, so she set out to make her work known. In October 1946, she began to review her documents and collect them so that she would be understood as a \"full partner\" in their missionary work. In addition, she began lecture tours in the United States in 1937 to promote the Schweitzer Hospital.\nHealth complications.\nSchweitzer experienced tremendous health issues throughout her life, mostly in relation to the lungs. She first encountered tuberculosis before she turned ten. She was officially diagnosed in the spring of 1922 with laryngeal tuberculosis after exhibiting symptoms of \"pain, fever, and the coughing up of blood.\" In addition the heat of Africa caused many respiratory issues. In 1915, she contracted phlebitis resulting in two weeks of therapeutic bed rest. She also had pneumonia in 1929, almost keeping her from returning to Lambaréné. Despite her already weak lungs, she completed the trip though she had to return early due to illness again.\nSchweitzer died on June 1, 1957, and her remains are located in Lambaréné. Once Albert died, he was buried next to her. Schweitzer's grave with Albert is \"on the banks of the Ogooue River is marked by a cross he made himself.\"\nLegacy.\nSchweitzer contributed greatly to the work done in Lambaréné. A role model as an independent, educated woman with a deep intellectual curiosity, she was \"One of the first female students at the University of Strasbourg\" and \"One of the first female employees in the community administration\" at the orphanage. Her aid in the poor relief system, \"Armenpflegesystem,\" mirrored in modern social welfare, saw the illegitimate mortality rate fall. Setting precedence as a female medical missionary in the early 20th century, she established lasting effects of nursing and education in Lambaréné. She co-founded the Schweitzer Hospital, documented much of Albert's autobiography, and \"supported the [mission] work with lectures and fund-raising\" essential to its upkeep and vivacity.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48695146","title":"Flood Mythology of China","body":"\nFlood Mythology of China\n\nThe Flood Mythology of China, or Great Flood of China (; also known as ) is a deluge theme which was happened in China. Derk Bodde (1961) stated that \"from all mythological themes in ancient Chinese, the earliest and so far most pervasive is about flood.\" The myth is also have shared characteristics with other Great Floods all over the world, although it also have unique characteristics or different focuses. Lu Yilu (2002) was grouping all versions of great flood into three themes: \"the heroes controls the flood; \"brother-sister marriage to repopulating the world\"; and \"the flood which is drowning the whole city along with its citizens\".\nHistory and mythology.\nLiterary history.\nThe history of China as a continuously recorded literary tradition begins with the ancient documents transmitted to posterity through the \"Records of the Grand Historian\". According to these, the great-grandson (or fourth successor) of the Yellow Emperor was Yao. Beginning with the reign of Yao, additional literary sources become available, including the \"Book of Documents\" (collected and edited by Confucius), which begins with the \"Canon of Yao\" (), describing the events of Yao's reign. Although, the \"Canon of Yao\" is problematic in regards to textual transmission (at best it seems to represent an early textual reconstruction and at worst a fabrication based on available knowledge or sources from the 3rd or 4th centuries CE). \"The Counsels of Great Yu\" 大禹謨 is considered to be one of the reliably transmitted pre-Qin texts. In any case, these and other texts of the preserved literature mark the beginnings of the Chinese historical tradition. Other important texts include the poem \"Heavenly Questions\" collected in the \"Chu Ci\" which is attributed to Qu Yuan and the famous mythological compendium \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\" (\"Shanhaijing\"). Furthermore, centuries of scholarship have gone into piecing together a narrative from the bits, pieces, and occasionally longer sections found in these and other early sources, sometimes being subjected to heavy editorial handling in terms of viewpoint.\nCollected mythology.\nMythological stories besides having been preserved both in various literary forms, have also been collected from various oral traditions, some of these folktales are still told. Some of these sources are from people of the Han ethnicity and some from other ethnic groups.\nThe struggles to control the flood.\nThe Zhou sources narrated the struggles of the heroes or deities to control the floods. From all of these stories, the struggle of Yao, Gun, and Yu is the most obvious in describing the hardness of human effort to control the flood. Much later works from the Warring States period (\"Shi Ben\") and \"Di wang shi ji\" (3rd century) were pairing Yu and Nuwa as a couple and their previously uncorrelated stories were then completing each other.\nGun-Yu Mythology.\nThis theme is based on the efforts of Great Yu (and Gun) to control the flood, sometimes is also associated with Emperor Yao and Shun, and the initial efforts of human to domesticated wild animals as pack animals and livestock. The theme outline narrates Gun stole xirang to stop the flood while Great Yu channeled the flood into the sea and succeeded to subsided the water level, and so the earth can be cultivated. There are so many mythologies which are correlated to this theme, one of which is \"Dragon Gate\" -a canal through the mountains which was dug by Yu. While he was digging the canal, many of the carps were swept away and fell, they were so disappointed because they couldn't swim back into the upper level. Yu promised them, if any of the carp could leap through his dam, it would transform into a dragon, thus the place inherited its name.\nGun-Yu theme is also have political background. Huainanzi stated that the great flood was caused by Gong Gong who was use the water to make havoc on the realm of Emperor Yao. Shan Hai Jing narrated another version that the flood was caused by Xiangliu, one of Gong Gong's minister, and was not Gong Gong himself.\nNuwa repaired the heaven.\nThe story was happened after Goddess Nüwa created (molded) humanity from yellow clay, brought them into life, and gave them the ability to reproduce. Gong Gong was banging his head into Mount Buzhou, which actually was the pillar to support the heaven. Nüwa then patched the sky with five-colored pebbles and piled up reeds ashes to stop the flood.\nThe extinction of human race.\nChen Jianxian (1996) said that this theme was one of some popular legends which was still being told by more than 40 ethnics in China. There is a possibility that the myth is rather new because the oldest recorded sources about this myth were from Six Dynasties, save that the oral tradition maybe much older.\nThe theme was made into several versions, but the outline is about a great flood which was destroyed all the humans all over the world except a pair of brother and sister, or aunt and nephew. Both were forced to married in order to repopulated the world. One version stated that their children were ordinary humans, while the others said it was a lump of meat, squash, melon, or grindstone; after they opened, cut, or destroyed it, humans emerged.\nSinking city.\nThis theme have some specific characteristics: one or two people were survived, the statue which was crying blood, and the whole city along with its citizens were sinking. The survivor(s) was being saved by the gods because of his/her benevolent acts; may be an old lady or a devoted son. The blood crying statue was often a stone lion statue, or sometimes tortoise statue.\nOther flood myths.\nEast Sea and Mulberry Field.\nA less widespread flood myth involves the goddess Magu: this myth involves the cyclic rise and fall of the ocean level over the eons: sometimes the sea floor is under water; at other times, it turns into mulberry fields. However, the material about Magu seems to be distinct from the idea of a great flood upon the land of China.\nOne tradition narrates Magu, a benevolent Taoist lady who lived on the second century. She was reclaiming a very wide seashore water bodies on Kiangsu and changing it into mulberry fields.\nHeyu.\nShan Hai Jing mentions a pig-like creature with human face, yellow-colored and red-tailed, and it sounds like human singing. The creature is known as \"Heyu\"; he preys on human, reptiles, and snakes. It appearance is a sign that there will be a great deluge all over the world.\n\n"}

She began as a community organizer and worked her way up to the labor division, finally becoming head of the Industrial Division from 1937 to 1947. At the end of World War II, when women were phased out of the labor market, she was briefly dismissed, but then hired back to organize support for the communities springing up around the defense industry. \nBiography.\nEleanor Gladys Copenhaver was born on June 15, 1896 in Marion, Virginia to Laura Lu (née Scherer) and Bascom Eugene Copenhaver. Both of Copenhaver's parents taught at the school her grandfather Scherer had founded, Marion Female College. She spent her childhood at the family home, \"Rosemont\", which also housed Rosemont Industries, an organization established by her mother, which marketed local handicrafts. After completing her primary education at the public schools of Marion, Copenhaver began her university studies at Marion College before she transferred in 1914 to Westhampton College in Richmond, Virginia. She completed her B.A. in English in 1917 and returned that same year to Marion to teach. In 1918, she enrolled in social work classes at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania and in 1919 worked in a settlement camp for New York City women during the summer. She completed her degree in 1920 earning a certificate in social economy.\nCareer.\nIn September 1920, Copenhaver became a Field Secretary on the national staff of the YWCA covering the south and central region. From 1920 to 1923 she was a rural community organizer. In addition to introducing the programs of the YWCA to local communities and churches, Copenhaver participated in seminars and retreats like one held in 1922, which explored the tenets of internationalism that had sprung up after the first World War. The YWCA believed that if women used their moral and professional authority, they would reshape the world. Copenhaver participated in the \"Conference at the Lake\" and after their presentation on relationships with Syrian and Japanese women, and the Bible study, she directed a play, which she had written with her mother. The basic theme was modernity and the enlightenment of women who could draw upon the past, their spirituality and their ability to work and use their intelligence. In 1923 she switched to industrial community activism then in 1925 became the National Industrial Secretary working out of New York. Her political beliefs became increasingly radical during her many visits to factories to counsel and organize working women. During one of these visits in 1928, she made a side trip to her family and met the writer Sherwood Anderson. Coperhaver returned to New York and enrolled in a master's program at Columbia University. She completed the degree in political economy in 1933 and later that same year, married Anderson.\nCoperhaver-Anderson continued working as a labor organizer. In 1937, she was promoted to head the Industrial Programs of the YWCA. Her work entailed investigating working and educational conditions, submitting reports for action and providing support for labor unions. She continued to travel with her job and the couple also traveled to visit Sherwood's artist and writer friends all over the world. On one of these trips, taken in 1941 after the death of her mother, the couple were in route to Valparaiso, Chile aboard the \"SS Santa Lucia\". Sherwood became ill with peritonitis, the couple disembarked, but he died at a hospital in Colón, Panama. After bringing him back to Virginia for burial, Anderson returned to work. She continued as the executive of the Y's industrial division and resumed her travels, going across the country, until the Industrial Department was phased out soon after the end of World War II. When that happened, in 1947, Anderson took a two-year assignment with the international YWCA in Italy to help with relief efforts. At the end of her assignment, she returned from Italy and was terminated by the Y due to their elimination of women's employment programs. She spent most of 1950 organizing Sherwood's papers and preparing them for donation to the Newberry Library in Chicago. The following year, she was rehired by the YWCA working on their United Community Defense Services, which was a program aimed at providing \"health, welfare, and recreation services\" to communities supporting the defense industry. She remained with the YWCA until her retirement in 1961.\nAfter her retirement, she served as Sherwood's literary executor as well as the overseer of his property at \"Ripshin\" and her mother's legacy at \"Rosemont\". Anderson died on September 12, 1985 in Marion, Virginia. Copenhaver's papers are located at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Many of the records can be found on-line as part of the \"Five College Finding Aids Access Project\", which was funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\n"}
{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48695217","title":"Perspective-n-Point","body":"\nPerspective-n-Point\n\nPerspective-\"n\"-Point is the problem of estimating the pose of a calibrated camera given a set of 3D points in the world and their corresponding 2D projections in the image. The camera pose consists of 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) which are made up of the rotation (roll, pitch, and yaw) and 3D translation of the camera with respect to the world. This problem originates from camera calibration and has many applications in computer vision and other areas, including 3D pose estimation, robotics and augmented reality. A commonly used solution to the problem exists for called P3P, and many solutions are available for the general case of . Implementations of these solutions are also available in open source software.\nProblem Specification.\nDefinition.\nGiven a set of 3D points in a world reference frame and their corresponding 2D image projections as well as the calibrated intrinsic camera parameters, determine the 6 DOF pose of the camera in the form of its rotation and translation with respect to the world. This follows the perspective project model for cameras:\nwhere formula_2 is the homogeneous world point, formula_3 is the corresponding homogeneous image point, formula_4 is the matrix of intrinsic camera parameters, (where formula_5 and formula_6 are the scaled focal lengths, formula_7 is the skew parameter which is sometimes assumed to be 0, and formula_8 is the principal point), formula_9 is a scale factor for the image point, and formula_10 and formula_11 are the desired 3D rotation and 3D translation of the camera (extrinsic parameters) that are being calculated. This leads to the following equation for the model:\nAssumptions and Data Characteristics.\nThere are a few preliminary aspects of the problem that are common to all solutions of P\"n\"P. The assumption made in most solutions is that the camera is already calibrated. Thus, its intrinsic properties are already known, such as the focal length, principal image point, skew parameter, and other parameters. Some methods, such as UP\"n\"P. or the Direct Linear Transform (DLT) applied to the projection model, are exceptions to this assumption as they estimate these intrinsic parameters as well as the extrinsic parameters which make up the pose of the camera that the original P\"n\"P problem is trying to find.\nFor each solution to PnP, the chosen point correspondences cannot be coplanar. In addition, P\"n\"P can have multiple solutions, and choosing a particular solution would require post-processing of the solution set. Furthermore, using more point correspondences can reduce the impact of noisy data when solving P\"n\"P. RANSAC is also commonly used with a P\"n\"P method to make the solution robust to outliers in the set of point correspondences. Most methods, however, assume that the data is noise-free.\nMethods.\nThis following section describes two common methods that can be used to solve the P\"n\"P problem that are also readily available in open source software and how RANSAC can be used to deal with outliers in the data set.\nP3P.\nWhen , the P\"n\"P problem is in its minimal form of P3P and can be solved with three point correspondences. However, with just three point correspondences, P3P yields many solutions, so a fourth correspondence is used in practice to remove ambiguity. The setup for the problem is as follows.\nLet \"P\" be the center of projection for the camera, \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" be 3D world points with corresponding images points \"u\", \"v\", and \"w\". Let \"X = |PA|\", \"Y = |PB|\", \"Z = |PC|\", formula_13, formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_21. This forms triangles \"PBC\", \"PAC\", and \"PAB\" from which we obtain the equation system for P3P:\nIt's common to normalize the image points before solving P3P. Solving the P3P system results in four possible solutions for and . The fourth world point \"D\" and its corresponding image point \"z\"are then used to to find the best solution among the four. The algorithm for solving the problem as well as the complete solution classification for it is given in the 2003 \"IEEE\" Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence paper by Gao, et. al. An open source implementation of the P3P can be found in OpenCV's \"calib3d\" module in the \"solvePnP\" function.\nEP\"n\"P.\nEfficient P\"n\"P (EP\"n\"P) is a method developed by Lepetit, et. al in their 2008 International Journal of Computer Vision paper that solves the general problem of P\"n\"P for . This method is based on the notion that each of the \"n\" points (which are called reference points) can be expressed as a weighted sum of four virtual control points. Thus, the coordinates of these control points become the unknowns of the problem. It is from these control points that the final pose of the camera is solved for.\nAs an overview of the process, first note that each of the reference points in the world frame, formula_23, and their corresponding image points, formula_24, are weighted sums of the four controls points, formula_25 and formula_26 respectively, and the weights are normalized per reference point as shown below. All points are expressed in homogeneous form.\nFrom this, the derivation of the image reference points becomes\nThe homogeneous image control point has the form formula_31. Rearranging the image reference point equation yields the following two linear equations for each reference point:\nUsing these two equations for each of the reference points, the system formula_34 can be formed where formula_35. The solution for the control points exists in the null space of and is expressed as \nwhere formula_37 is the number of null singular values in formula_38 and each formula_39 is the corresponding right singular vector of formula_38. formula_37 can range from 1 to 4. After calculating the initial coefficients formula_42, the Gauss-Newton algorithm is used to refine them. The and matrices that minimize the reprojection error of the world reference points, formula_23, and their corresponding actual image points formula_24, are then calculated.\nThis solution has formula_45 complexity and works in the general case of P\"n\"P for both planar and non-planar control points. Open source software implementations of this method can be found in OpenCV's Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction module in the \"solvePnP\" function as well as from the code published by Lepetit, et. al at their website, .\nUsing RANSAC.\nP\"n\"P is prone to errors if there are outliers in the set of point correspondences. Thus, RANSAC can be used in conjunction with existing solutions to make the final solution for the camera pose more robust to outliers. An open source implementation of P\"n\"P methods with RANSAC can be found in OpenCV's Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction module in the \"solvePnPRansac\" function\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48695290","title":"Promoter activity","body":"\nPromoter activity\n\nPromoter activity is a term that encompasses several meanings around the process of gene expression from regulatory sequences —promoters and enhancers. Gene expression has been commonly characterized as a measure of how much, how fast, when and where this process happens. Promoters and enhancers are required for controlling where and when an specific genes is transcribed.\nTraditionally the measure of gene products (i.e. mRNA, proteins, etc.) has been the major approach of measure promoter activity. However, this method confront with two issues: the stochastic nature of the gene expression and the lack of mechanistic interpretation of the thermodynamical process involve in the promoter activation.\nThe actual developments in metabolomics product of developments of next-generation sequencing technologies and molecular structural analysis have enable the development of more accurate models of the process of promoter activation (e.g. the sigma structure of the polymerase holoenzyme domains) and a better understanding of the complexities of the regulatory factors involved.\nPromoter binding.\nThe process of binding is central in determining the \"strength\" of promoters, that is the relative estimation of how \"well\" a promoter perform the expression of a gene under specific circumstances. Brewster et al., using a simple thermodynamical model based on the postulate that transcriptional activity is proportional to the probability of finding the RNA polymerase bound at the promoter, obtained predictions of the scaling of the RNA polymerase binding energy. This models support the relationship between the probability of binding and the output of gene expression\nMathematical representation of promoter binding.\nThe problem of gene regulation could be represented mathematically as the probability of n molecules — RNAP, activators, repressors and inducers — are bound to a target regions.\nTo compute the probability of bound, it is needed to sum the Boltzman weights over all possible states of formula_1 polymerase molecules\non DNA. Here in this deduction formula_1 is the effective number of RNAP molecules available for binding to the promoter.\nThis approach is based in statistical thermodynamics of two possible microscopic outcomes: \nThe statistical weigh of promoter unoccupied \"Z(P)\" is defined:\nformula_3\nWhere the first term is the combinatorial result of taken formula_1 polymerase of formula_5 non-specific sites available, and the second term are the boltzmann weights, where formula_6 is the energy that represents the average binding energy of RNA polymerase to the genomic background (non-specific sites).\nThen, the total statistical weight formula_7, can be written as the sum of the formula_8 state and the RNA polymerase on promoter state:\nformula_9\nWhere formula_10 in the formula_11 state is the binding energy for RNA polymerase on the promoter (where the s stands for specific site).\nFinally, to find the probability of a RNA polymerase to binding (formula_12 ) to an specific promoter, we divide formula_13 by formula_14 which produces:\nformula_15\nWhere, formula_16\nAn important result of this model is that any transcription factor, regulator or perturbation could be introduced as a term multiplying formula_1 in the probability of binding equation. This term for any transcriptional factor (here called factor regulators) modify the probability of binding to:\nformula_18\nWhere formula_19 is the term for transcriptional factors, and it has the value of formula_20 for increase of formula_21 for decrease of the number of RNA polymerase available to bind.\nThis result has an important significance to represent mathematically all the possible configurations of transcriptional factor by derive different models to estimate formula_19 (for further developments, see also ).\nEukaryotes promoter structure.\nThe process of activation and binding in eukaryotes is different from bacteria in the way that specific DNA elements bind the factors for a functional pre-initiation complex. In bacteria there is a single polymerase, that contain catalytic subunits and a single regulatory subunits known as sigma, which transcribe for different type of genes.\nIn eukaryotes, the transcription is performed by three different RNA polymerase, RNA pol I for ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), RNA polymerase II for messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and some small regulatory RNAs, and the RNA polymeerase III for small RNAs such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs). The process of positioning of the RNA polymerase II and the transcriptional machinery require the recognition of a region know as \"core promoter\". The elements that could be found in the core promoter include the TATA element, the TFIIB recognition element (BRE), the initiatior (Inr), and the downstream core promoter element (DPE). Promoters in eukaryotes contain one or more of these core promotes elements (but any of them are absolutely essential for promoter function), these elements are binding sites for subunits of the transcriptional machinery and are involve in the initiation of the transcription, but also they have some specific enhancer functions. In addition, the promoter activity in eukaryotes include some complexities in the way of how they integrate signals from distal factors with the core promoter.\nEvolutionary processes.\nUnlike in protein coding regions, where the assumption of sequence conservation of functionally homologous genes have been frequently proved, there is no a clear relationship of conservation between sequences and their functions for regulatory regions. The transcriptional promoters regions are under less stringent selection, then have a higher substitutions rates, allowing transcription factor binding sites to be replaced easily be new ones arising from random mutations. Notwithstanding the sequence changes, mainly the functions of regulatory sequences remain conserved.\nIn recents years with the increase of availability of genome sequences, phylogenetic footprinting open the possibitlity to identify cis-elements, and then study their evolution processes. In this sense, Raijman et al., Dermitzakis et al. have developed techniques for analyzing evolutionary processes in transcription factor regions in Saccharomyces species promoters and mammalian regualatory networks respectively.\nThe basis for many of these evolutionary changes in nature are probably related with events within the cis-regulatory regions involve in gene expression. The impact of variation in regulatory regions is important for disease risk due their impact in the gene expression level. Furthermore, perturbations in the binding properties of proteins encoded by regulatory genes have been linked with phenotypes effects such as, duplicated structures, homeotic transformations and novel morphologies.\nMeasure of promoter activity.\nThe measure of the promoter activity has a broad meaning. The promoter activity could be measured for different situations or research questions, such as:\nMethods to study promoter activity commonly are based in the expression of a reporter gene from the promoter of the gene of interest. Mutations and deletions are made in a promoter region, and their changes on couple expression of the reporter gene are measured.\nThe most important reporter genes are the fluorescence proteins as GFP. These reporters allow to measure promoter activation by increasing fluorescent signals, and deactivation by decrease in the rate of fluorescence.\n\n"}

During the 1980s, his theory was the most influential and dominant explanation of the formation of the Ottoman Empire.\nBiography.\nWittek was conscripted at the outbreak of World War I as a reserve officer to an artillery regiment. In October 1914, he suffered a head wound in Galicia and was taken to Vienna to recover. Subsequently, he served first on the Isonzo and in 1917 was drafted as a military adviser to the Ottoman Empire, where he was stationed in Istanbul and Syria until the war ended. During this time Wittek learned Ottoman Turkish and acquired the patronage of Johann Heinrich Mordtmann, the former German consul in Istanbul. After the war ended, Wittek returned to Vienna and continued his studies of ancient history, which he had already begun before the war. In 1920 he obtained his doctorate with a study of the oldest Roman social and constitutional history.\nWittek was in Vienna at the emergence of the fledgling discipline of Ottoman studies. He was co-editor and author of the first scholarly journal in this field called \"Messages to Ottoman history\", which was published from 1921 till 1926. For his livelihood Wittek worked as a journalist for the Austrian Rundschau. From 1924, he worked for the German Archaeological Institute, where he focused on the early Ottoman epigraphy. Together with Turkish historians, he managed to prevent the sale of the Ottoman archives to Bulgaria as scrap paper.\nAfter the rise of Nazism in 1934 Wittek moved to Belgium, where he worked at the Institute for Byzantine Studies in Brussels with Henri Gregoire. After the German attack on Belgium Wittek fled in a small boat to England, where he was interned as an enemy alien. By supporting British Orientalists he was finally released and found a job at the University of London. After the war he returned to his family, who had remained in Belgium. In 1948 he returned to London and took over the newly created Chair of Turkish at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), where he remained until his retirement in 1961.\nWittek, who was close to the George circle, has published little, but has become very powerfully in his discipline. His only books, \"The Principality Menteşe\" and \"The Rise of the Ottoman Empire\" appeared in the 1930s.

Moving with his family to Champaign, Illinois early in his life, he attended the University of Illinois there, graduating in 1875. He worked at the school for the next seven years, until he was dismissed over a conduct violation. In 1885, he became director of the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Kentucky. Scovell was named dean of the College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment there shortly before his death.\nBiography.\nMelville Amasa Scovell was born February 26, 1855, in Belvidere, New Jersey. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to Jasper County, Illinois. They later moved to Champaign, where his father worked as a principal. Scovell enrolled at the University of Illinois in 1871, studying chemistry. He graduated in 1875 and became an instructor there. From 1876 to 1877, he served as the secretary to university president John Milton Gregory.\nScovell was named an assistant professor of chemistry in 1877, receiving a Master of science the next year. He was made professor of agricultural chemistry in 1880. He co-founded a method of clarifying cane sugar juice, but was forced to leave the university in 1882 because professors were expected to abstain from profiting from their research. Scovell founded a sugar factory in Champaign, but it was short-lived. He also worked as a special agent of the US Department of Agriculture following his dismissal.\nIn 1885, Scovell accepted a position at the Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, a position he held until his death. There, he promoted agriculture in Kentucky, with a focus on Jersey cattle. James Ben Ali Haggin commissioned Scovell to purchase cattle for his Elmendorf Farm. In 1893, Scovell was chairman of the dairy test at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Illinois in 1909. In 1911, Scovell was named dead of the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment.\nScovell died at his Lexington home from endocarditis on August 15, 1912. He married Nancy Davis, a member of his university class, in 1880; they had no children. Scovell served terms as president of the American Association of Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations and the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists. He was also a member of the Fair Committee of the Kentucky State Fair from 1907, when it moved to Louisville, until his death. He was a member of the Society of Chemical Industry and the American Chemical Society. He is the namesake of Scovell Hall at the University of Kentucky.\n\n"}

Founded on March 22, 1913 as Canada's Only National Fraternity, Phi Kappa Pi has active chapters in Burnaby, Halifax, Toronto, and Montreal, as well as 6 inactive chapters. There are alumni chapters associated with most locations, as well as a National Council.\nHistory.\nPhi Kappa Pi Fraternity was founded in 1913, by two previously existing and separate organizations. Sigma Pi, founded in Toronto in 1901 and Alpha Beta Gamma, founded in Montreal in 1905, joined forces to create Canada's first and only national fraternity. The individual organizations' names would then become chapter names.\nIn 1923, alumni from the Alpha Beta Gamma chapter approached the Phi Kappa Pi National Council about the possibility of expanding to Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The expansion request was approved and a chapter was founded. The chapter was the first fraternity to locate to Dalhousie's campus, and was named the Dalhousie chapter, until 1959 when it received it's Greek name, Zeta Gamma. The following year, 1924, Alpha Iota was founded at the University of British Columbia, followed by Delta Mu in 1930 at the University of Alberta, Tau Sigma Rho in 1935 at the University of Manitoba, and Alpha Epsilon in 1967 at the University of Waterloo.\nThe 1970s proved to be a tough decade for Phi Kappa Pi, with 4 chapters being lost. Alpha Iota and Alpha Epsilon both closed down in 1974, followed by Tau Sigma Rho in 1975, and one of the founding chapters, Alpha Beta Gamma in 1976. Alpha Beta Gamma, however, would be reopened in 1990 with the help of alumni from Phi Kappa Pi's then remaining two chapters. Soon after, in 2000, Theta Kappa Omicron opened at the University of Ottawa, and Omega Iota in 2006 at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology.\nIn September 2008, Simon Fraser University's student body voted 57% in favour of overturning the University's ban of Greek life on campus. The Omega Epsilon chapter opened on the university's campus in 2012. Phi Kappa Pi was the first Greek Life Organization to open on the Simon Fraser campus. \nChapters.\nUntil at least 1976, the chapter names are the name of the local from which it was formed, except in the case of Dalhousie.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48121588","title":"Orthogonal ligand-protein pair","body":"\nOrthogonal ligand-protein pair\n\nOrthogonal ligand-protein pairs (also known as re-engineered ligand-receptor interfaces or re-engineered enzyme-substrate interactions) are a protein-ligand binding pair made to be independent of the original binding pair. This is done by taking a mutant protein (naturally occurring or selectively engineered), which is activated by a different ligand (carefully synthesized or selected). The intention here is that the orthogonal ligand will not interact with the original protein. The original protein will also be designed to not interact with the orthogonal ligand in certain cases. An example of orthogonal ligand-receptor interfaces are RASSL and DREADD. They are G protein-coupled receptors that are activated by synthesized ligands that wouldn't normally exist in the cell, such as the anti-psychotic Clozapine, allowing researchers to control the interaction externally and independent of internal activation.\nApproaches and Designs.\nProtein Engineering Approach.\nThe protein engineering approach involves synthesizing a new ligand and directed mutation of the protein's ligand-binding site. In this approach one has to be careful to only change the ligand specificity without changing the other actions of the protein.\nSteric Modification.\nThe steric modification design can be summarized into 3 changes to the ligand-protein pair: \nReversal of hydrogen bonds or charge-charge interactions.\nAnother way to design an orthogonal protein is to switch the position of the hydrogen bond acceptors and donors. For example, if the ligand is a hydrogen bond donor and the protein a hydrogen bond acceptor, switch the ligand to the hydrogen bond acceptor and the protein to the donor. The reversal of charged interactions is similar, but it involves switching the position of the positive charge and the negative charge on the protein and ligand.\nSynthetic Chemistry Approach.\nThe synthetic chemist's approach is to take an already existing mutant form of the protein that binds the original ligand weakly, and synthesize a new ligand for which the mutant protein has a strong affinity. The drawback of this approach is the protein still interacts weakly with the natural ligand at low synthetic ligand concentrations.\nConfirmed Applications.\nAgriculture.\nInduced drought resistance.\nPark et al. created an orthogonal receptor-ligand interface between and . normally binds to abscisic acid which together then bind and inactivate to PP2C as a drought stress response, which stops PP2C from deactivating . This causes a cascade that leads to the activation of the and closing of the leaf guard cells and stomata. The result is less water loss by the plant. The natural response by the plant using abscisic acid to bind PYR1 in drought conditions is not strong enough and is activated too late to significantly hinder crop yield loss. Abscisic acid is also currently too expensive to synthesize to be used as a spray to control drought response artificially on a mass scale. The ability to control this externally by spraying the PYR1MANDI (orthogonal receptor) with mandipropamid (orthogonal ligand and fungicide) has the potential to reduce crop yield loss during droughts in plants with these engineered receptors, and has been confirmed to work in canola.\nMedicine.\nHormonal Pathway Control.\nDesigning ligands for mutant receptors that are unresponsive to the natural ligand could prove to be an effective way to treat disease. TRβ histidine 435 is a T3 insensitive mutant that plays a role in human pituitary cancer and RTH. Hassan and Koh showed QH2 (orthogonal ligand) was able to allosterically activate the mutant TRβ nuclear hormone receptors that had lost their responsiveness to endogenous T3 (natural mutants) but retained their DNA binding activity.\nResearch.\nGene Expression:.\nMixing and matching the ligand-binding domains and DNA-binding domains of different hormone receptors can be used as an inducible expression mechanism to study the action of any gene with a hormone response element in its promoter. Selectively altering the ligand-binding domain to make it orthogonal to the natural ligand-receptor interface, as well as the making the DNA-binding domain and hormone response element orthogonal, would give a researcher precise control of a gene's transcription in order to study a gene's action.\nSignal Transduction:.\nStudying signal transduction pathways and attempting to identify the action of proteins involved in these pathways is difficult due to the abundance and complexity of interactions, families of proteins with the same or similar action, and the relative a lack of selectivity for substrates (a good example of which are protein kinases). A method has been developed to use a radioactively labeled ATP orthogonal analog with an orthogonal kinase that uses the ATP analog to phosphorylate its substrates, allowing for identification of its targets within the pathway by the radioactive label that it will add the target. Variations on this approach can be used to identify the function of signal transduction proteins whose function remains undetermined.\n\n"}

The election was necessitated by the announcement of Speaker John Boehner's resignation, set for October 30. The Speaker of the House follows the Vice President in the line of succession to the presidency of the United States in accordance with the Presidential Succession Act.\nDue to friction within the Republican Party caucus, Boehner decided to step down as speaker and resign his seat in Congress. He scheduled a Republican caucus non-binding vote for speaker on October 8, and a full floor vote on October 29. Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader and second-in-command to the Speaker, was initially viewed as the favorite to win the Speakership. However, due to the opposition of the Freedom Caucus, McCarthy dropped out of the race on October 8, and the caucus vote was postponed.\nJason Chaffetz initially declared his candidacy to challenge McCarthy, and Bill Flores declared his candidacy after McCarthy withdrew, but both dropped out later to express their support for Paul Ryan, who entered the race after being widely viewed as a potential frontrunner. Daniel Webster of the Republican Party and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the Democratic Party were also declared candidates. Ryan won the rescheduled caucus vote on October 28, and was elected Speaker of the House, receiving 54.6% of the House vote, on October 29.\nBackground.\nProcess and conventions.\nThe Speaker of the United States House of Representatives is the presiding officer of the United States House of Representatives, and is second in the United States presidential line of succession, after the Vice President and ahead of the President pro tempore of the United States Senate. Though the Constitution does not require that the Speaker be an elected member of the House of Representatives, every Speaker to date has been elected from House membership.\nThe 435 members of the House of Representatives elect a Speaker by majority rule at the beginning of each session of the United States Congress, who serves until the end of the Congress. Typically, the election is a formality, as the majority party's members vote as a bloc for their party's previously-chosen Speaker-designate (such as the speaker, majority leader, or minority leader from the previous term). Open elections are uncommon but have occurred. The last Speaker election to require multiple ballots occurred in 1923.\nSpeakership and resignation of John Boehner.\nJohn Boehner, a member of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007. As the Democratic Party assumed control of the House following the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some House Republicans reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should they be able to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker at the beginning of the 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not vote for him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.\nThroughout 2015, Boehner and the Freedom Caucus remained at odds. Boehner stripped his opponents of leadership posts and other perks, while the American Action Network, a group allied with Boehner, aired television ads against Freedom Caucus members in their home districts. Meanwhile, the Freedom Caucus opposing Boehner's plans, forcing him to rely on Democratic votes to pass bills. Needing to pass a federal budget for the 2016 fiscal year beginning October 1, the Freedom Caucus, now consisting of approximately 40 conservative Republicans affiliated with the Tea Party movement, threatened to block a resolution from passing unless it would defund Planned Parenthood and to initiate a vote to vacate the speakership if Boehner did not support their demands. The caucus sought the following promises: (1) the decentralization of the House Steering Committee, so that the Speaker and House Majority Leader are not solely in charge of committee assignments, (2) not supporting an increase in the U.S. debt ceiling without entitlement reform, (3) willingness to impeach John Koskinen, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and (4) passing spending bills approved by the caucus rather than a continuing resolution favored by Democrats in the United States Senate.\nOn July 28, 2015, Mark Meadows, a member of the Freedom Caucus from North Carolina, filed a motion to vacate the speakership, only the second time the motion had been filed. The next day, Boehner referred to the motion as \"no big deal.\" However, following continued pressure from the Freedom Caucus, and to avoid the vacation of his speakership, Boehner announced on September 25 that he would resign the Speakership and retire from Congress effective October 30. Sources from his office indicated he chose to resign due to the increasing discord within the Republican caucus so that he could manage passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government and avoid a government shutdown.\nCandidates.\nOn September 28, Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Majority Leader, and Webster announced that they would run for Speaker of the House. McCarthy was considered the presumptive favorite in the race. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah and the Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, announced his candidacy on October 4, claiming that McCarthy did not have the votes to win the election. Several Republicans urged Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the running mate of Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, to run for Speaker, but he declined, saying he is a \"policy guy\" with a preference to focus on his role as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\nDemocrat Nancy Pelosi, who served as the Speaker from January 2007 through January 2011, asked her Democratic colleagues for their vote in the election. Steny Hoyer, the House Minority Whip, said that he expects that the \"overwhelming majority\" of Democrats will vote for Pelosi. He said that if a Republican cannot get the votes needed, Democrats may consider their options.\nOn October 7, the day before the Republican caucus scheduled a non-binding vote for speaker, Ryan and former Vice President Dick Cheney endorsed McCarthy, as did 11 of the 13 House Republicans from Pennsylvania. The Freedom Caucus decided to endorse Webster in the race. Other Republicans said they would vote against McCarthy, including Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who called McCarthy \"absolutely not an option\" because of his previous role as Boehner's \"right-hand man\". Also, Walter B. Jones, Jr. of North Carolina sent a letter to the Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers stating that any candidates for a leadership position with \"misdeeds\" should withdraw from the race. Jones has stated that his comment did not specifically refer to McCarthy, but it was widely seen as referring to rumors that McCarthy had been committing an extramarital affair with a fellow Representative, a rumor that both have denied; the basis for such an allegation and interpretation is unclear.\nCiting opposition from within the Republican Party, as well as fallout from controversial comments he made about the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi, McCarthy dropped out of the race on October 8. Following McCarthy's departure from the race, Republicans renewed their efforts to recruit Ryan as a candidate. Boehner personally called Ryan twice to ask him to run, and Chaffetz said that he would not run against Ryan if he chose to enter the race. Ryan also received calls from Mitt Romney and Trey Gowdy, among others, encouraging him to run for Speaker. Additional Ryan endorsements came from Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, 2016 Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise from Louisiana. On October 9, close aides of Ryan confirmed that Ryan was reconsidering the possibility of a run.\nA possible Ryan candidacy received support from the same Freedom Caucus that opposed Boehner and McCarthy, as Meadows said on October 11 that Ryan running would \"definitely change the equation,\" and Chairman Jim Jordan described Ryan as \"a good man\" and stated that the Freedom Caucus would view a Ryan run \"favorably.\"\nOthers who expressed their interest in running included Texas representatives Bill Flores and Michael McCaul, Georgia representative Lynn Westmoreland, Montana representative Ryan Zinke, and California representative and former Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa. However, several candidates have made clear that they would only run if Ryan chooses not to, including Issa, McCaul, and Minnesota representative John Kline. On October 12, Flores confirmed that he would run for Speaker. He stated that he would run only if Ryan stayed out of the contest.\nRyan held a closed-door meeting with the Republican Caucus on October 20, where he explained that he would run for Speaker if he could be guaranteed an overwhelming majority of the Republican caucus would support him. Specifically, Ryan requested an increased threshold for the political maneuver of vacating the Speakership, stated that he would not lessen the amount of time he spends with his family, and requested an official endorsement from the Freedom Caucus, Republican Study Committee, and The Tuesday Group by October 23, before he could make his decision. Immediately after Ryan's announcement, Chaffetz announced that he would be dropping out of the race to support Ryan. The next day, the Freedom Caucus held a vote to determine which of its members would support Ryan; although the exact tally was not revealed, roughly two-thirds of the caucus voted to endorse Ryan. Although this was shy of the 80% vote needed for an official endorsement over Webster, both the caucus leaders and Ryan were satisfied with the result, and Ryan made efforts to move forward with a potential Speaker bid.\nOn October 22, Ryan announced his bid for Speaker. Flores, who chairs the Republican Study Committee, dropped out of the race and endorsed Ryan. Mo Brooks of Alabama, a member of the Freedom Caucus, announced on the floor of the House on October 27 that Ryan had agreed not to advance immigration reform legislation while Barack Obama is President of the United States, or unless it meets the \"Hastert Rule\", as it has the support of the majority of Republicans.\nDeclared.\nThe following officially declared their candidacy:\nPublicly expressed interest.\nThe following publicly expressed interest in becoming candidates:\nReceived speculation.\nThe following received speculation about a possible candidacy in at least two reliable sources:\nWithdrawn.\nThe following were candidates, but subsequently withdrew:\nDeclined to run.\nThe following received some speculation about a possible candidacy, but subsequently ruled themselves out:\nElection.\nHouse Republicans planned to hold a non-binding caucus vote on October 8, followed by the official floor vote on October 29. The winning candidate requires a 218-vote majority to win. Multiple ballots may be cast if the majority of the House cannot agree on a candidate. While McCarthy and Chaffetz both said they would vote for the winner of the caucus vote in the floor vote, Webster did not make the same promise.\nFollowing McCarthy dropping out of the race on October 8, the caucus vote was indefinitely postponed. Massie and Peter T. King referred to the House as a \"banana republic.\" Massie also criticized Boehner for postponing the election, saying they \"called off the election because they didn’t like the result,\" which was echoed by Tom Rice, Louie Gohmert, and Justin Amash. McMorris Rodgers and Conference Vice Chairwoman Lynn Jenkins defended Boehner, saying the matter was handled properly, as conference rules give him sole discretion. Rich Lowry of \"National Review\" asked McCarthy in a phone interview if the House was governable, to which McCarthy replied \"I don’t know. Sometimes you have to hit rock bottom.\" Charlie Dent, a Republican from Pennsylvania who had supported McCarthy, suggested that if Republicans are unable to agree on a candidate, the best option might be for a bipartisan coalition to select a Speaker.\nOnce it appeared certain that Ryan would run, and win an overwhelming majority of the caucus's votes, Boehner rescheduled the Republican caucus vote for October 28. Ryan won the nomination, defeating Webster 200 to 43 in the secret ballot voting. Blackburn and McCarthy each received one vote. The next day, Webster reportedly urged Republicans to vote for Ryan instead of him.\nFinal result.\nOn October 29, Ryan was elected Speaker with 236 of the 432 votes cast. Others receiving votes were Pelosi (184), Webster (9), Jim Cooper, John Lewis, and Colin Powell (1 each). Votes were cast by 432 of the 435 House members.\nFollowing the election, Raúl Labrador, a Freedom Caucus member from Idaho, said that Paul will need to \"realize the honeymoon is over and start bringing us some conservative policy,\" and that \"the final exam for Paul Ryan will be in January 2017, when there is a Speaker election, and we will look at his body of work and determine whether he gets a passing grade or not.\"\n\n"}

It was one of the earliest comic strips inspired by the popularity of a celebrity. \nBackground.\n\"Charlie Chaplin's Comedy Capers\" was published in the Chicago Herald. The comic strip cashed in on the tremendous popularity of the comedian at the time. It was created by Stuart Carothers in March 1915, who drew and wrote the stories until his tragic early death from defenestration. Two cartoonists named \"Warren\" and \"Ramsey\" took over the series until they were replaced by Elzie C. Segar, at that time still an amateur. On February 29, 1916 Segar published his first Chaplin strip. The daily version ran until July 15, 1916. His Sunday version ran longer, from March 12, 1916 until September 16, 1917. It was his first professional cartooning job. Contrary to his predecessors, who mostly borrowed ideas from Chaplin's films, Segar thought up his own jokes. He gave Chaplin a tiny sidekick named \"Luke the Gook\" to act as a straight man to his gags. \nReception.\nDespite Chaplin's popularity the comic strip wasn't a huge succes in the United States, mostly due to the fact that all artists involved were basically amateurs. It fared better in the U.K., where it was published in the weekly comics magazine \"Funny Wonder\" for decades. \n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48123672","title":"San Francisco Ballet Building","body":"\nSan Francisco Ballet Building\n\nThe San Francisco Ballet Building, located in San Francisco, California, was designed by architect Beverly Willis and completed in 1984. The New York Times identified it as “the first building in the United States to be designed and constructed exclusively for the use of a major ballet company.”\nOverview.\nThe San Francisco Ballet Building is located within the Civic Center, San Francisco. Beverly Willis’s design would later serve as a model for the design of future American ballet companies and schools. Upon completion, the San Francisco Ballet Building became a landmark achievement in the ballet world. The Boston Globe noted, “Dance people don’t merely visit the San Francisco Ballet building: They make pilgrimages to it.”\nBallet History.\nThe San Francisco Ballet was the first professional ballet company in the United States. The company was founded in 1933 as the San Francisco Opera Ballet under the leadership of ballet master Adolph Bolm. In 1942, the ballet separated from the San Francisco Opera to become its own independent company. The company’s performances are currently based in the War Memorial Opera House, San Francisco. It is among the world’s leading dance companies, presenting over 100 performances annually, with a repertoire that spans both classical and contemporary ballet. Along with American Ballet Theatre and the New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet has been described as part of the \"triumvirate of great classical companies defining the American style on the world stage today.\"\nWith its origins in turn-of-the-century traveling companies, the San Francisco ballet routinely rented practice studios. In the late 1970s, the company was housed in a renovated parking garage on 18th Avenue, San Francisco, in a downstairs studio with ceilings so low that the dancers could not practice lifts for fear of hitting the beams. On the east coast, ballet companies like the American Ballet Theatre, were also housed in rented spaces and buildings shared with other performing arts groups. In 1983, the San Francisco Ballet Association became “the first American ballet company and school to break this pattern by constructing new quarters for itself.\"\nDesign.\nBeverly Willis performed exhaustive research into the function of a ballet building, conducting numerous interviews with dancers on their needs and visiting the studios of major European ballet companies.The building includes facilities to support all of the activities of the company and school with the exception of set storage. The eight rehearsal and classroom studios have 15 feet high ceilings, to accommodate lifts, and average 56x40 feet in size. Additionally, there are administrative offices, a library with audiovisual equipment, and multi-purpose rooms for conferences, academic and choreographic study. Student and company members have physical therapy and workout rooms with gymnastic equipment, locker rooms with showers, separate lounges, and a computer room. Spaces accessible to the public include the ballet shop and a ground-floor studio for community outreach programs.\nWhile the project would serve as a prototype for new ballet schools nationwide, the design was required to extend deference to the classical order of the Civic Center’s architecture, characterized by grandeur of scale, simplicity of geometric forms, and dramatic use of columns. The San Francisco City Planning Department developed a set of design criteria for the building that specified a height of 96 feet, the location of cornice line levels, and the color and finishes of exterior materials, to ensure that the design was in context with the Neo-Renaissance architecture of the Civic Center. \nTo accomplish this, Willis incorporated elements of the Neo-Renaissance architectural vocabulary of the Civic Center− the rectangular geometry and the horizontal tripartite divisions of the base, middle and top, whose heights correspond to the opera house. The building’s planned location was on an elongated and rectangular site, one-sixth the size of the adjacent performing arts structures. To be successfully contextual, it needed to appear massive to sustain a visual relationship with the monumental civic center buildings occupying over a square block. Willis sized the facade to monumental, classical proportions. The four story facade equaled in height a typical 8 story office building. The horizontal divisions of the base, midsection and top, as part of the facade, matched the heights of those of the adjacent civic center buildings. The rectangular form of the envelope produced a classical form, into which the ballet’s interior functions fit. The proportion of the plan itself was a three to one classical ratio. The building is clad in a concrete material similar in color and texture to the other contemporary civic center structures.\nBreaking with the classical tradition of symmetry, the proscenium-style main entry is located on the corner of the site. The building’s two-story monumental entry at the corner accomplished several objectives: it connected the building with the Civic Center’s master plan axis; it gave the building an identity within the performing arts complex, from the Van Ness Avenue perspective where the Opera and Symphony faced; and it avoided orienting the main entry towards the Opera House’s blank rear wall.\nThe facade came out of the program like an abstraction and manifestation of the idea of ballet. The entry was envisioned as a proscenium arch. The rippling, curved glass within the entry is reminiscent of a stage curtain. The curved balconies over the entry arch are reminiscent of theater box seats. The facade is designed with solids and voids, curves and planes that play in constantly shifting light and shadows. The monumentality of the mass is softened by transparent layers that reveal the creative possibility, awaiting the birth of dance.\n\n"}

If a topological space is endowed with a Kuranishi structure, then locally it can be identified with the zero set of a smooth map formula_1 Kuranishi structure was introduced by Japanese mathematicians Kenji Fukaya and Kaoru Ono in the study of Gromov–Witten invariants in symplectic geometry.\nDefinition.\nLet formula_2 be a compact metrizable topological space. Let formula_3 be a point. A Kuranishi neighborhood of formula_4 (of dimension formula_5) is a 5-tuple\nwhere\nThey should satisfy that formula_12.\nIf formula_13 and formula_6, formula_15 are their Kuranishi neighborhoods respectively, then a coordinate change from formula_16 to formula_17 is a triple\nwhere\nIn addition, they must satisfy the compatibility condition:\nA Kuranishi structure on formula_2 of dimension formula_5 is a collection\nwhere\nIn addition, the coordinate changes must satisfy the cocycle condition, namely, whenever formula_34, we require that\nover the regions where both sides are defined.\nHistory.\nIn Gromov–Witten theory, one needs to define integration over the moduli space of stable maps formula_36(see for example ). They are maps formula_37 from a nodal Riemann surface with genus formula_38 and formula_39 marked points into a symplectic manifold formula_2, such that each component satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation\nIf the moduli space is a smooth, compact, oriented manifold or orbifold, then the integration (or a fundamental class) can be defined. When the symplectic manifold formula_2 is semi-positive, this is indeed the case (except for codimension 2 boundaries of the moduli space) if the almost complex structure formula_43 is perturbed generically. However, when formula_2 is not semi-positive, the moduli space may contain configurations for which one component is a multiple cover of a holomorphic sphere formula_45 whose intersection with the first Chern class of formula_2 is negative. Such configurations make the moduli space very singular so a fundamental class cannot be defined in the usual way.\nThe notion of Kuranishi structure was a way of defining a virtual fundamental cycle, which plays the same role as a fundamental cycle when the moduli space is cut out transversely. It was first used by Fukaya and Ono in defining the Gromov–Witten invariants and Floer homology, and was further developed when Fukaya, Oh, Ohta, Ono studied the Lagrangian intersection Floer theory.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48125333","title":"Hayle and Bristol Steam Packet Company","body":"\nHayle and Bristol Steam Packet Company\n\nThe Hayle and Bristol Steam Packet Company operated steam ship services between Hayle, Ilfracombe and Bristol in the mid nineteenth century. Confusingly from 1848 to 1860, the company name was used by two separate operators.\nHistory.\nAlthough a steamer first called at Hayle in 1824, regular weekly services began in 1831, when the \"Hayle Steamship Company\" was formed operating with the wooden vessel \"Herald\", under the command of John Vivian.\nThe engineering company Harvey's of Hayle built the engines for the PS \"Cornwall\" of 1842. When the Great Western Railway arrived in Bristol, this stimulated more travel between London and the South West of England, and the PS \"Cornwall\" was added to the Hayle service under the command of John Vivian. The extra business attracted a rival when Vivian Stevens of St Ives put his PS \"Brilliant\" on to the Hayle to Bristol route. \nThe \"Hayle Steamship Company\" was renamed the \"Hayle and Bristol Steam Packet Company\" in 1848, and confusingly Vivian Stevens with the PS \"Brilliant\" adopted the same title.\nThe original \"Hayle and Bristol Steam Packet Company\" launched a prospectus in 1857 to attract capital investment. The secretary of the new company was Mr John Vivian of Hayle. The company was launched with nominal capital of £28,750 (£ in ) and working capital of £23,000 (£ in ). The company prospectus announced that a First Class A.1. 12 years Iron Steamer was being built at Hayle, by Harvey and Co, capable of carrying 200 Tons of Cargo, with ample accommodation for passengers. The cost of this new steamer was £18,000 (£ in ), and in 1858, the company launched the Cornubia. The company also planned to sell the Cornwall for £2,000 (£ in ) when the SS \"Cornubia\" was launched.\nThe additional traffic was short-lived, as the extension of railway services from London and Bristol through into Cornwall was completed when the Royal Albert Bridge was completed and opened on 2 May 1859.\nBoth Hayle and Bristol Steam Packet Companies amalgamated around 1860, probably as a result of traffic diminishing. The company undertook voluntary liquidation following a meeting of the shareholders on 6 November 1861. Steamer services continued, and attempted competition with screw vessels. Having sold off the SS \"Cornubia\", Harveys built and owned the SS \"Bride\" of 1863 and SS \"Bessie\" of 1865. However, the two ships could not compete with rail travel for both passengers and freight, and were moved to other trades. \nThe Hayle to Bristol services reduced and were operated by \"Hosken, Trevithick, Polkinhorn and Company Ltd\" of Penzance which bought the screw steamer \"Norseman\" in 1893. The \"Norseman\" was replaced with the \"M.J. Hedley\", a steam coaster carrying passengers until 1917 on a weekly service linking Bristol, Hayle and Liverpool.\n\n"}

He is considered an \"Asia hand\" and is a specialist in the fields of public diplomacy and digital diplomacy. He has been characterized as \"an unconventional diplomat\".\nEducation.\nAttracted by its “counterculture atmosphere”, McDowell attended Innis College at the University of Toronto. He received a MA from University of Toronto in East Asian Studies in 1988. He attended the Kennedy School of Government as a Fulbright Scholar, earning a Master of Public Administration in 2008, and stayed on as a visiting Research Scholar at the Ash Institute for Democratic Governance and Innovation.\nMyanmar.\nMcDowell was named Canada's first ever resident ambassador to Myanmar in March 2013. Because of the long period of sanctions imposed by Canada on Myanmar, the relationship between the two countries was very limited and cold.\nSince taking up his job in June 2013, relations have warmed considerably, with Canada naming Myanmar a priority country for both trade and aid and opening a visa office. Ambassador McDowell has focused much of his attention on supporting grassroots democracy and human rights organizations working on issues such as freedom of speech and voter and civic education. He has staked out a leading role for Canada in the area of federalism and minority rights, and in the promotion of LGBT rights in this laboratory for democracy. Canada has also started to cooperate on security related issues like border management and prevention of human trafficking.\nThe Embassy of Canada has had success in rapidly raising Canada's public profile in Burma, through both traditional and social media. Its Facebook presence has over 140,000 followers on its Burmese, English, and French pages.\nPublic Diplomacy and E-diplomacy.\nMcDowell is known as an innovator in public diplomacy and e-diplomacy. Canada’s Globe and Mail credits him with \"helping drag the Department of Foreign Affairs into the Internet age”, and Canada’s former Ambassador to China called him “among the most original of thinkers when it comes to using social media”.\nE-diplomacy.\nAmbassador McDowell is a frequent speaker and participant in e-diplomacy conferences, offering a practitioners perspective. In 2015 he spoke at events organized by the foreign ministries of Armenia and the Netherlands.\nHe is known for starting Canada's social media presence in China with \"canadaweibo\" on the Chinese Sina Weibo platform (see www.weibo.com/canadaweibo). Canadaweibo grew from zero to 400,000 followers within two years, becoming the second largest and most influential embassy site in China after the USA’s. Similarly, he has made social media a priority during his posting in Myanmar (see www.facebook.com/CanadainBurma).\nMcDowell's work in e-government is longstanding. He gave the government of Canada's address to the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society in 2002. At that time he also took a leading role in initiatives in Canada related to getting Aboriginal communities online, and disseminating news about the international activities of Canadian Aboriginal peoples.\nPublic Diplomacy.\nMcDowell has worked on public diplomacy throughout his diplomatic career, and was a Director of Public Diplomacy and Domestic Outreach in Canada’s Department of Foreign Affairs.\nHe wrote a brief primer on public diplomacy based on a talk he delivered at the 100th Anniversary Edward R. Murrow Memorial Conference at the Fletcher School for Law and Diplomacy (see www.fletcherforum.org/2012/07/26/32-3/). In a 2010 talk at the Fletcher School on the connection between domestic outreach and public diplomacy abroad, he coined the concept of \"total diplomacy\", engaging and partnering with segments of the domestic audience to achieve foreign policy goals. McDowell has been connected with “panda diplomacy” for his work in bringing a pair of Chinese pandas to Canada, and “sports diplomacy” for his public diplomacy in Burma connected with the traditional Burmese sport of chinlone.\nA conversation with McDowell forms one of the chapters of Chinese public diplomacy thinker Zhao Qizheng’s 2012 book “The Wisdom of Public Diplomacy: Cross-Border Dialogues”.\nPrevious Diplomatic Career.\nTaiwan.\nMcDowell served in Taipei from 1997-2001.\nAboriginal Affairs.\nMcDowell was deputy Director for Aboriginal Affairs in the Global Issues Bureau from 2001-2003.\nThailand.\nMcDowell was posted in Thailand from 2003-2007.

He served as the Deputy Leader of the CHP responsible for foreign relations between 3 November 2014 and 11 November 2015. He was part of the CHP delegation during coalition negotiations with the Justice and Development Party following the June 2015 general election. Before entering politics, Özçelik served as the Turkish Consul General at Shanghai from 1997 to 1998, as the Turkish Ambassador to Iraq from 2009 to 2011 and as the Undersecretary of Public Order and Security from 2011 to 2012.\nEarly life and career.\nMurat Özçelik was born on 1 January 1954 in Ankara and graduated from TED Ankara College before going on to study at the Department of Management at the Middle East Technical University (OTDÜ) Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences. He is married with two children.\nCivil service career.\nÖzçelik started working at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1983. Between 1990 and 1992, he served as the Cabinet Chief for Turgut Özal, the then-President of Turkey. After serving at numerous other positions, he became the department manager at the Office of Information in 2005, serving concurrently as the foreign affairs deputy spokesperson. On 16 November 2011, he was appointed as the Undersecretary of Public Order and Security. Following a public statement by Özçelik, in which he claimed that he was being pressrued into not doing his job the way he wanted and that he wanted to resign, the government removed him from the position on 17 May 2012. He was subsequently appointed as an advisor at the Foreign Ministry and subsequently retired there.\nDiplomatic career.\n2 January 1997, Özçelik became the Turkish Consul General at Shanghai, a position in which he served until 22 September 1998. On 26 December 2006, he became the Assistant Special Representative to Iraq. He became the Special Representative to Iraq in 2007 and was appointed as the Ambassador to Iraq in 2009. He was removed from this position on 22 October 2011 upon the decision of the government.\nPolitical career.\nÖzçelik was a candidate to become a member of the Party Council of the Republican People's Party (CHP) during the party's 18th Extraordinary Convention held on 7 September 2014. However, he failed to win enough votes to enter the council, resulting in the party leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu appointing him as a personal advisor. It was alleged that Özçelik had stated in a closed meeting that he had voted for the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), though had the support of Kılıçdaroğlu since it was perceived that Kılıçdaroğlu wanted to give the task of forming a strong foreign policy to Özçelik. Numerous members of the party council who won a higher number of votes subsequently resigned from their positions in order to allow Özçelik to take a seat, which he did in October 2014. On 3 November 2014, he was appointed as the Deputy Leader of the CHP responsible for foreign relations. In the June 2015 general election, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for İstanbul's third electoral district. During a Party Council meeting on 24 August 2015, it was alleged that Özçelik had an argument with rival council member Durdu Özbolat, developing into a fight between the two men. This, as well as the fact that Özçelik had not been elected through a nomination primary before the June 2015 election, allegedly contributed to Kılıçdaroğlu's decision to not put him forward as a candidate for the November 2015 general election. Özçelik subsequently resigned his Deputy Leader position, but withdrew his resignation shortly after. He resigned as Deputy Leader and from the Party Council on 11 November 2015.\nControversy.\nÖzçelik has been controversial within the CHP for allegedly being in favour of an independent Kurdistan on the southeastern borders of Turkey. He has also been described as having close sympathies with the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), whom he claimed he, his family and his friends voted for in the June 2015 general election.\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48126401","title":"Vladimir Tsyganko","body":"\nVladimir Tsyganko\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich Tsyganko (; ; also Țâganco, Tziganco, Tziganko or Țiganco; 1887 – 1937) was a Bessarabian, and later Soviet, politician. The son of a distinguished architect, and himself an engineer by vocation, Tsyganko entered politics shortly before the proclamation of a Moldavian Democratic Republic, when he earned a seat in the republican legislature (\"Sfatul Țării\"). He sided with the parliamentary Peasants' Faction, which supported left-wing ideals and pushed for land reform, being generally, and radically, opposed to the more right-wing Moldavian Bloc. Tsyganko was skeptical of the Bloc's plan to unite Bessarabia with Romania, although he possibly supported a federation. His uncompromising stance divided his Faction and led the Romanian Kingdom's authorities to identify him as a major obstruction to the unionist cause. \nIn November 1918, as the Bloc switched its support to unconditional unification and dissolved the regional government bodies, Tsyganko rejected the new regime and moved to Odessa. Allying himself to members of the White movement, with whom he set up a Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia, attending the Paris Peace Conference to campaign for the reversal of the union. He later settled in Soviet territory, where he helped create a Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic; other members of his family opted to stay behind in Romania. In 1937, Tsyganko fell victim to the Great Purge.\nBiography.\nEarly career.\nTsyganko was born in Kishinev (Chișinău), regional capital of the Bessarabian Governorate, Russian Empire, and was a graduate of Riga Polytechnicum. He returned to his native city where his father Vladimir (? – 1919), an architect, designed such landmarks as the Ethnography Museum and Saint Nicholas Church; his brother Nikolai (Nicolai) Vladimirovich (born 1882) was the \"zemstvo\" engineer in Orhei, and from 1909 in Kishinev itself. By 1904, their father was the Director of Monastery Estates in Bessarabia, in which capacity he testified against Russian police after the Kishinev pogrom, accusing them of passivity. In 1916, the Bessarabian journalist Alexis Nour described Tsyganko Sr. as a \"much esteemed [...] Bessarabian intellectual of a Moldavian nationalist hue, but not a separatist\" (\"see Moldovenism\"). Also according to Nour, Nikolai, whom he met personally, could speak only Russian. Romanian politician Duiliu Zamfirescu, who met and debated with Vladimir Vladimirovich in 1918, claimed that the Tsygankos were \"Ruthenian\". He and his adversary talked in French, as Tsyganko \"could not speak a word of Romanian\".\nTsyganko reached political prominence after the October Revolution, which had left Bessarabia to administer itself independently, as a \"Moldavian Democratic Republic\". In January 1918, the local Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies began to override the \"Sfatul Țării\" assembly (appointed the previous November) and attempted to bring about Bolshevik rule. This move was swiftly suppressed by a punitive expedition of the Romanian Army. The 3rd Peasants' Congress, assembled few days after the occupation of Chișinău, adopted an anti-secessionist position, dismissed the Moldavian prime-minister Pantelimon Erhan from the position of President of the Peasants' Soviet, and elected a new leadership from among the most vocal opponents of the Romanian intervention. According to the Rumcherod's newspaper, during the opening session, Tsyganko's message on behalf of the local Socialist Revolutionary branch was met with applause and calls to support the Russian Revolution. The following day, after demanding the withdrawal of Romanian troops within 24 hours, and negotiating on the issue with the Romanian military, the Congress' Presidium was put under arrest. General Ernest Broșteanu dismissed the immunity of those Peasants' representatives who were also members of \"Sfatul\", and issued a strong warning against further anti-Romanian agitation. Consequently, the following days the Congress selected a new list of \"Sfatul\" representatives, headed by Tsyganko, which comprised mostly moderates.\nClashes with the unionists.\nTsyganko, who was counted among the representatives of the Russian minority, affiliated with the left-wing \"Peasants' Faction\", which stood in opposition to the \"Moldavian Bloc\" of Romanian nationalists. During the debates on land reform, he suggested postponing the discussion until a new government, \"representative of the people's will\", would be approved by a Moldavian Constituent Assembly. Presumably, he feared that pressure from the Romanian troops would affect the extent of the reform. Nevertheless, he became the first chairman of \"Sfatul\"s Agrarian Commission, and in parallel presided upon the Peasants' Soviet. Despite being involved in left-wing politics, Tsyganko would gradually develop a working relationship with Andrei Krupenski, the Polono-Bessarabian landowner and ex-Marshal of Nobility, and Alexandr K. Schmidt, who stood for the conservative side of anti-Romanian agitation; between 1918 and 1920 the three men issued calls for the end of Romanian occupation, and began popularizing their cause in Europe. \nWhen Romanian Premier Alexandru Marghiloman traveled to Bessarabia to canvass for the unionist cause, he found the Peasant Faction divided between followers of Ion Inculeț, who endorsed the Romanian viewpoint, and deputies who sided with Tsyganko. Zamfirescu, who traveled with Marghiloman, recalls that Tsyganko \"thrice in one month\" attempted to recall the Republic's Directorate, his moves resisted by Inculeț. He also protested the selection of pro-Romanian students from Kiev and Odessa as representatives of the Transnistrian Moldavians, in which he saw efforts to shake the balance of power inside the \"Sfatul\". Zamfirescu claims to have saved Tsyganko from an undisclosed mortal danger, and then to have conversed with him, trying to gain insight into his political motivations. The latter, he concluded, were \"most phantasmagorical socialist ideas\", not dissuaded by the prospect of \"death, suffering, military disaster, sheer destitution, or degeneracy\". He adds: \"It was late at night, I was experiencing chills, and so I believe I have insulted the convictions of this visionary youth, reassuring him that all opinions lead to a ministerial chair, provided one makes sure to discard them on cue.\"\nDespite proclaiming its independence in late February 1918, the Moldavian Republic was still seen in various circles as subordinate to the neighboring Ukrainian People's Republic. Its Central Rada wished to represent Bessarabia in the preliminary negotiation of the Bucharest peace treaty, imposed by the Central Powers on Romania. The Moldavian Regional assembly reacted by reaffirming its independence and rejecting the division of Bessarabia, against the decisions of Akkerman and Khotin \"zemstva\", which had proclaimed their accession to the Ukraine. A Moldavian delegation was therefore selected to head to Kiev and obtain from the Central Rada official recognition of Moldavia's independence. The delegation, which included the interior minister Vladimir Cristi, the nationalists Nicolae Secară and Teodor Neaga, and Tsyganko as representative of the Peasants' Faction, was prevented from leaving. According to the unionist Gheorghe Andronachi, it was Daniel Ciugureanu, the Republic's pro-Romanian prime minister, who intervened with the Romanian Army to hamper the departure, fearing that an international recognition of independence would hinder nationalist plans for union with Romania.\nMarch union vote.\nOn March 27, 1918, when \"Sfatul\" voted to support the union with Romania, Tsyganko effectively abstained. Zamfirescu found it \"unbelievable\" that Romanian-speaking peasants had ever endorsed Tsyganko, who, he claimed, \"systematically opposes Bessarabia's government and Romania's policies, endeavoring for its annexation to the Ukraine\"; however, he also notes that Tsyganko himself accused the Romanians of wanting to hand in Bessarabia to the Ukrainians. A radical project for land reform had received pledges of support from \"Sfatul\" secretary Ion Buzdugan, and also from the Marghiloman himself; consequently, according to historian Alberto Basciani, Tsyganko's critique of unionism became marginal within his own party and Soviet.\nOn behalf of the Peasant Faction, Tsyganko denied the Assembly had the authority to discuss such and issue, declaring his group would refrain from voting, since they considered this a matter for a Constitutional Convention; furthermore, he stated the only admissible terms for a union between the Moldavian and Romanian peoples would be in a federation. Five members of his faction decided to side with the nationalists and voted for the union, while the other 17 present abstained. Researchers are divided in their assessments of Tsyganko's political stance at that early stage. Basciani describes him as one of those who \"opposed with great vehemence the union of Bessarabia with Romania\". However, according to Svetlana Suveică, Tsyganko did not object to union with autonomy, and in fact saw it as \"the only solution for avoiding the Bolshevik invasion of the region.\"\nIn November, after the generalization of Romanian military rule in Bessarabia, Tsyganko, as putative \"president\" of the Bessarabian Peasants' Party, with Nicolae Alexandri, Ion Păscăluță, and 37 other \"Sfatul\" members, sent a letter of protest to the Romanian government of Constantin Coandă. This coalition of Romanian Bessarabians and White Russians demanded the immediate recognition and restoration of autonomy, as well as the lifting of the martial law; however, its imperatives were rejected as illegitimate by the central authorities. According to Clark: \"We cannot but applaud the admirable aims of the 40 Deputies, in most of their requests; but at the same time we must wonder at their ingenuousness; they did not foresee the constant turbulence on the Eastern frontier, which even at that time impressed the Roumanians\".\nNovember union vote.\nThe protest arose controversy in political circles. Tsyganko reported a private interview with the Romanian envoy Artur Văitoianu. He quoted the latter as offering a deal: \"You must renounce [autonomy] if only for this sole reason—that you no good Roumanian officials in Bessarabia—that is to say, none who are good nationalists. If you give up autonomy, you will not have a Commissioner-General, but you will have a Bessarabian Chargé d'Affaires, a man of your own character, who will be nominated by the Central Power. The new [Bessarabian] Directorate will remain in office until the meeting of the Pan-Roumanian Constitutional Assembly. Does this appeal to you as attractive?\" Also according to Tsyganko, Văitoianu informed the group that they needed to coalesce with Romanian nationalists in front of Great Russian revivalism, and that \"the national idea takes precedence over everything\", implicitly threatening \"Sfatul\" dignitaries.\nAs Suveică writes, it was only at this stage that Tsyganko became an adversary of the unionist camp, placing his hopes in a reestablishment of the Russian Republic, and her re-annexation of Bessarabia. At the last \"Sfatul\" session, on November 25, 1918, unconditional union was proposed for ratification, as one of several measures being voted on, alongside the allocation of offices and a land-reform-law. According to the Peasants' Faction account, also supported by many of the Moldavian nationalists who had signed the earlier protest, the Moldavian Bloc kept the opposition uniformed about there being a \"Sfatul\" session: \"only Mr. V. Tziganko was aware of the fact, and he was informed privately, two hours before the opening of the sitting.\" The Tsyganko group confronted the assembly's president, Halippa, arguing that his election was illegal. They announced another walk-out, to which voices of the Moldavian Bloc responded with rhetorical questions (\"Is this how you intend to solve the agrarian issue?\") and taunts of \"Good riddance!\"\nThe opposition maintained that the walk-out resulted in a lack of quorum: only 48 of 160 deputies were reportedly present, which made the voting results questionable. Tsyganko and his colleagues accused the Bloc of putting up unconditional union for the vote as a rider, at 2.30 AM on the morning of November 26, and counted the votes during considerable and purposeful commotion. Some of the Fraction deputies in the opposition, including Tsyganko and Gavril Buciușcan, actually returned in time to cast their Nay votes. Clark claims that one of the Moldavian Bloc representatives testified that there were enough deputies present. According to Moldavian Bloc's Pan Halippa, Tsyganko's walk-out from the Assembly Hall proved to be a miscalculation, as the Peasant Faction's other members returned to vote on land reform, and, subsequently, on the unconditional union. Marghiloman nevertheless gave a contrasting account. He complained that \"not even 30 deputies\" had been present for the vote abrogating the conditions, in spite of \"all the money spent\".\nSalvation Committee.\nIn early 1919, Tsyganko emigrated from what was then being recognized as Romanian territory. He settled in Odessa, a Ukrainian port city, where he established the Peasants' Faction in exile, alongside a dozen other former \"Sfatul\" deputies. He joined efforts with Krupenski and Schmidt, affiliating with their Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia, whose activities were closely monitored by Romania's secret police, the Siguranța. According to the Moldavian Bloc's Petru Cazacu, they answered indirectly to Anton Denikin, commander of the Volunteer Army. \nThe various groups of Bessarabian autonomists and White loyalists agreed to send a common delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris, where the Allies were debating on recognizing the union. On February 10, the Committee issued a common platform for these organizations, sharing two goals: \"the liberation of Bessarabia from the Romanian annexation and the realization of the aspirations of the people of Bessarabia.\" The latter referred to the region's reintegration into Russia. In April, together with Krupenski and Schmidt, later followed by Mark Slonim and Mihail Savenco, Tsyganko had arrived in Paris. In its addresses to the international media, the group insisted that the union was a putsch by urban intellectuals against the other social classes. It also circulated a protest against the Romanian land reform project, which the Salvation Committee saw as a chauvinistic attack against the landed gentry and the Russian patriots. \nAs noted by Suveică, Tsyganko was the only delegation member to belong to a non-aristocratic elite, and nominally an appointee of the \"Central Committee of the Peasants of Bessarabia\". He therefore took some distance from the conservative demands of the Salvation Committee, and in various contexts presented himself as an independent emissary, united with the others mainly in their common support for a plebiscite clause in Bessarabia. However, his autonomism and Krupenski's loyalism were mostly endorsed by the White émigré lobby in Paris, including the likes of Georgy Lvov, Vasily Maklakov, Sergey Sazonov, and Nikolai Tchaikovsky. In his papers, Halippa commented that Tsyganko, the self-proclaimed \"socialist and revolutionary\", had arrived in Paris as a propagandist of Russian nationalism, \"with no connection to the people [of Bessarabia]\". Cazacu also notes that the \"bizarre association\" comprising Tsyganko, Maklakov and Schmidt propagated the contradictory claim that \"Sfatul\" was a \"Bolshevik\" assembly.\nIn June 1919, the French communist organ, \"L'Humanité\", gave exposure to Slonim and Tsyganko's allegations regarding political repression and \"atrocities\" in Bessarabia, as a common protest of the \"democrats and socialists\". Such allegations were responded to by the BPȚ's Ion Pelivan, who wrote the newspaper to argue that Romania's intervention had first of all restored \"liberty and democracy\" in Bessarabia, and that the union expressed \"the free will of the Bessarabian populace, with no outside intervention.\" Countering Tsyganko's claim to speak for the peasants, the pro-Romanian delegation grew to include peasant members such as Ion Codreanu, Gheorghe Năstase, and Sergiu Victor Cujbă.\nLater life.\nMaking his split from the White Russian community a definitive one, Tsyganko eventually settled in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In September 1921, he wrote a memorandum on Bessarabia and Romania–Russia relations, which he sent to Leon Trotsky, the Commissar for Military Affairs. His text informed the Russian viewpoint at the negotiations in Warsaw between the Soviets and the Romanians, but also presented personal observations on the social makeup of Bessarabia. Tsyganko argued that the Moldavian Republic's creation and union were attributable to left-wing \"agitators\" such as Inculeț and Pantelimon Erhan. He claimed that multi-ethnic Bessarabia was naturally \"internationalist\", but also rural and \"well-off\", concluding that an anti-Romanian revolt could happen if sustained from across the border. Cazacu noted in 1924 that the dossier compiled by the Bolsheviks and the earlier Salvation Committee drafts used as sources the same documents, including statements by private individuals.\nIn 1924, Tsyganko became a founding figure of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, created on Soviet territory as a Bessarabian rump state. In September 1926, he was at Odessa, where, together with Ivan Krivorukov, he issued a formal protest against Italy's recognition of the Bessarabian union with Romania, and therefore against her \"passage into the anti-Soviet camp\". Nikolai Vladimirovich, meanwhile, remained behind in Romania, working as a conservator for the Historical Monuments Commission, then as Department head for Chișinău City Hall. In early 1929, Nikolai supported the Bessarabian regionalist platform for administrative reform (an initiative by Erhan and Alexandru Mîță). He died some five years later, at age 52, while reading a book. At some point during the 1930s, Vladimir Tsyganko was singled out as a political suspect by the Stalinist regime, and was murdered in 1937, at the height of the Great Purge.\n\n"}

In the mid-eighteenth century, between the end of Gabriele III's marquisate and the beginning of Carlo Emanuele Malaspina's one, some lignite benches were discovered for the mining of the so-called \"Caniparola coal\".\nThe toponym derives from the cultivation of the cannabis (canapa, in Italian) that was held in the area in the past.\nSociety.\nDemographic Evolution.\nDuring the second half of XIX century, this frazione had an outstanding demographic increase (which is corresponded to a likewise increase of the built infrastructures and houses), so that, counted with the near localities (above all Borgetto-Melara), from 2001 onwards it began representing almost the half of the total population of the comune. The only frazione, on the other hand, has a population that would place as the first between the frazioni, but as second compared to Fosdinovo, the chief town. Today Caniparola is a residential place, although it still keeps vineyards and olive groves of its agricultural past.\nReligion.\nCaniparola is seat of the Sant'Antonio da Padova Parish, in the diocese of Massa Carrara-Pontremoli. From September 2015, it is part of Fosdinovo Pastoral Unity, within Fivizzano Vicariate. Patron Saint Day is 13 June.\nCulture.\nEducation.\nCaniparola is seat of the detachment of the statal school \"Don Florindo Bonomi\", consisting of kinfergartens, elementary and secondary school. The chief seat is in Fosdinovo.\nSport.\nCaniparola has got a great public gym and a stadium, \"Mulattieri\", placed in the locality Borghetto-Melara, where some football tournaments are held, like Trofeo Città di Fosdinovo and Memoriale Federico Severino. In Caniparola the matches of the chief Fosdinovo volley team, \"Volley C.P.O. Fosdinovo\", are played. The female sector takes part to the regional Championship.\n\n"}

She is the niece of Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militant organisation that has been in conflict with the Turkish Armed Forces since the 1980s, making both her candidacy and election to Parliament highly controversial.\nEarly life.\nDilek Öcalan was born on 3 October 1987 in Şanlıurfa as the daughter of Fatma Öcalan, the sister of imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan. On 23 December 2013, she visited her uncle at İmralı Prison and became known to the media after she gave a press statement detailing the conversation between them. Öcalan has been imprisoned since 1999, serving aggravated life imprisonment under charges of founding and leading a terrorist organisation (namely the PKK, which is recognised as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the European Union and the United States).\nPolitical career.\nÖcalan first entered politics in 2012, a year before meeting her uncle on the Island of İmralı. During the third congress of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), she was elected to the party executive while the party changed its name to Democratic Regions Party (DBP) and adopted a fraternal relationship with the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).\nMember of Parliament.\nÖcalan's candidacy to become a Member of Parliament despite being the niece of Abdullah Öcalan was heavily controversial, drawing strong opposition from Turkish nationalists.

Nevertheless, she was put forward as a HDP candidate for the electoral district of Şanlıurfa, being fielded as the second candidate on the HDP's provincial party list. She was subsequently elected in the June 2015 general election to become one of the youngest MPs in the new Parliament, resulting in her being appointed to the temporary Speaker's Council until a new Council could be elected in July.\n\n"}

The album was released less than two months after their fifth studio album, \"Depression Cherry\".\nDescribed by the band as \"not a companion to \"Depression Cherry\", or a surprise, or b-sides,\" \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" was unexpectedly announced nine days before its release via the band's Twitter account. It received mostly positive reviews from critics.\nBackground and recording.\nThe album was recorded at Studio in the Country in Bogalusa, Louisiana, and mixed at Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, Texas. Although the album was recorded simultaneously alongside \"Depression Cherry\", the band felt that the records should be seen as distinct unconnected works. \nReception.\n\"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" was released to highly positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 80, based on 13 reviews.\nJayson Greene of Pitchfork suggested the songs took on a \"darker edge\" than those from \"Depression Cherry\", judging the songs to feel smaller by having stripped away the typical cathedral-like reverb from the group's previous albums. Greene likened the mood of the songs to Beach House's material before they joined Sub Pop, describing the feeling as \"pneumatic, dusty, like they are pulling a blanket around themselves in a heatless attic to ward off a threatening chill.\" Although the \"joy and comfort have vanished\" from the material, Greene claimed that that album is \"still undeniably a Beach House album, a familiar mix of warm tones and chilly sentiments.\" Ultimately, Greene welcomed the addition to the band's repertoire, but suggested that a new album so soon created a dissonance that feels like \"too much of a good thing.\"\nIn a review from \"The A.V. Club\", Corbin Reiff described the album as \"most assuredly a continuation of many of the same motifs and hallmarks of the group's last release.\" Reiff hailed the band's craft, arguing that \"Beach House has mastered the art of space by this point and seems to have an instinct for how long to drag out a keyboard melody or a guitar line before bringing in another element to keep things from bogging down.\" Although he felt \"Depression Cherry\" and \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" were similar in motif, Reiff praised the band's decision to separate the songs, rather than tack them onto the former. For Reiff, \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" supports itself as a singular entity where \"the full sonic and emotional weight is tremendous.\"\nWriting for \"Rolling Stone\", Meagan Fredette gave praise to Victoria Legrand's vocals stating that \"her singing on \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" feels more playful than usual, a welcome lightness that comes across from the first moments of \"Majorette,\" the album's opener\". Elegy to the Void was also singled out as a highlight of the record with Fredette describing the track as \"the album’s crown jewel\" and \"as good a summation as any of what Beach House does best\". Emphasising the maturity of the record in comparison to the band's debut, she suggests that \"Like all their albums, this one is full of songs made for dreaming of a bygone love, or humming quietly to a new one\".\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48126947","title":"Calmodulin in Target Binding and Recognition","body":"\nCalmodulin in Target Binding and Recognition\n\nCalmodulin (CaM) is a complex signaling protein that transduces transient calcium ion signals. CaM's binding of calcium ions cause conformational changes, which interact with downstream proteins. Current research indicates that selective protein binding occurs through the mechanism of mutually induced conformational fit, which would explain how calcium dynamics in CaM would modulate its interaction.\nCurrent research on CaM signaling and CaM-BT interaction includes experimental kinetic rate observations and coarse grain/all atom Molecular dynamics simulations. Because protein signaling and protein-protein interaction is a new field of research, many observed interactions cannot be explained through experiment alone. The unification between simulation and experimental results is necessary to expand the predictive power of the theoretical approach and create general laws that explain the mechanics of signaling/protein-protein interactions.\nThe computational approach for modeling macro molecules is very resource intensive. The Hamiltonian equation in molecular dynamic software relates each atom to all other atoms in the system through kinetic, electrostatic, van der Waals, dihedra, bond, etc. energies. For example, the RRK polypeptide (CaMKII residues: 293-313) contains 21 residues and 318 atoms. For a single time step, the molecular dynamics software must perform energy calculations between every atom in the polypeptide, which is ~100,000 calculations. Since the time step must be in the sub picosecond range (to insure stability), several million time steps must be performed to obtain meaningful data.\nTo remedy the large number of calculations involved in all atom simulations, the coarse grain simulation technique can be used. Current work from the biophysics group at the University of Houston uses open source coarse grain and all atomic models of CaM and wildtype/mutated binding targets of CaMKII in their research.\n\n"}

Martin Stuart-Fox noted that Holbrook's criticism of natural selection was a \"cobble together, in a sort of scissors-and-paste criticism... the book contains no vigorous argument at all. Not only is Holbrook very obviously no scientist, he is no philosopher either.\"\nEcologist Arthur M. Shapiro in a review for the National Center for Science Education commented:\nDavid Holbrook, Fellow of Downing College, Cambridge, has written a polemic not so much against evolution as against scientific reductionism (which he sees incarnate in neo-Darwinism).

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48127002","title":"Ryan Walker (cartoonist)","body":"\nRyan Walker (cartoonist)\n\nRyan Walker (1870-1932) was an American political activist and cartoonist. A prolific artist who published political cartoons in a variety of radical newspapers and magazines in the United States, Walker is best remembered as the creator of the recurring character \"Henry Dubb,\" an American worker who ambled through life blithely being victimized by capitalism ostensibly as a result of his blind acceptance of the ideas of the ruling class.\nA member of the Socialist Party of America during his younger years, Walker's political views hardened with the coming of the Great Depression in 1929 and he joined the Communist Party, USA the following year, joining the editorial staff of the party's English-language daily newspaper in New York City. Walker died of pneumonia in June 1932 while on a visit to the Soviet Union.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nRyan Walker was born in Springfield, Kentucky on December 26, 1870. His father, Edwin Ruthwin Walker, was a farmer who later became a lawyer and moved the family to the Midwestern metropolis of Kansas City, Missouri, where Ryan attended public school.\nShowing a proclivity for art from an early age, submitting his first free lance cartoons to \"Judge\" in 1883, at the age of 13. These were not of sufficiently finished quality to appear in the pages of the magazine, but the ideas were accepted and redrawn into a two page center spread and back cover cartoon by a house artist, for which Walker received a royalty check of $15. He received positive reinforcement from the magazine's editor to continue at the cartooning craft and to hone his drawing skill.\nUpon leaving school Walker studied for a time at the Art Students' League in New York City, before working for a number of years in a series of manual jobs, refining his drawing in his spare time. \nWalker's private portfolio grew until in 1895 he was finally able to land his first permanent artistic job, a position in the advertising department of the \"Kansas City Times.\" He showed aptitude with a pen and took an acute interest in political issues and he was shortly made an editorial cartoonist for that paper, remaining in that position until 1898. In that year he moved to St. Louis, Missouri to take a position as cartoonist for the \"St. Louis Republic,\" where he would stay until 1901, taking time to get married to his Kansas City sweetheart, journalist Maud Helena Davis, in October 1899.\nThe year 1901 saw a move to Boston, where he did a stint as cartoonist for the \"Boston Globe,\" leaving after one winter. He subsequently worked as a freelance cartoonist, publishing work in a variety of prominent newspapers and magazines of the day, including the \"New York Times,\"\"Life,\" \"The Arena,\" and \"The Bookman.\" \nWalker moved from freelance to syndicated work in 1904, joining with the Baltimore based International Syndicate as a cartoonist. He would stay with that firm until 1911, when he left to pursue political pursuits fulltime.\nSocialist years.\nFrom 1902 Walker contributed material to a glossy socialist monthly published in New York City during the first five years of the 20th Century, \"The Comrade.\"\nWalker turned a close eye to the social problems of his day and developed politically radical views, declaring in a 1905 interview that\n\"My aim, hope, and life-work is the betterment of my brother man. Nothing else counts. I believe the present economic system is cruel, unjust, and essentially wrong, and wrong is wrong, no matter how it may be disguised... I am a Socialist because I believe that Socialism will lead to the development of the greater self, to the out-blossoming of all that is finest and highest in individual life, and that it will secure for all the people a measure of prosperity, happiness, and freedom...\"\nIt was through the pages of the socialist \"Appeal to Reason,\" a mass circulation weekly published in Southeastern Kansas to which he began regularly contributing in 1906, that Walker first gained popular fame. It was in those pages that he first introduced the character \"Henry Dubb,\" an American worker who unthinkingly rejected the ideas of unionism and socialism, only to accept as inevitable his victimization by the violence and corruption of the social system around him. Exposed as a dupe and a fool by his worldly wife and somehow cognizant child, the oblivious and intractable protagonist would respond to his latest existential insult with an unblinking stare into space and the catchphrase \"I'm Henry Dubb!\" — an easy to understand depiction of the effects resulting from so-called false consciousness among the working class.\nWalker would come to publish two collections of Henry Dubb cartoons in hard covers, \"Adventures of Henry Dubb\" (1914) and \"New Adventures of Henry Dubb\" (1915), testimony to the character's enduring appeal among American radicals during the decade of the 1910s.\nIn addition to a steady stream of cartoons, beginning in 1912 Walker toured the country as a stump speaker on behalf of the Socialist Party of America, Walker was effective in his role as a socialist lecturer, so much so that his abilities were lauded by party orator Eugene V. Debs, who declared him a \"great cartoonist\" and \"equally great\" public speaker, who could delight and hold an audience of socialists and non-socialists alike. Walker was directly employed by the National Office of the Socialist Party as one of the touring speakers for its Lyceum Bureau from 1915 to 1916, working in close association with Lyceum director and future Communist Party leader L. E. Katterfeld.\nFollowing a conservative turn of the editorial line of the \"Appeal\" during the years of World War I, Walker would take his art and the Henry Dubb character to the pages of the New York City socialist daily \"New York Call\" and later to its successor, the \"New Leader.\" The left wing press being notoriously underfunded, Walker would supplement his socialist-related work with regular employment as the Director of the Art Department of the \"Evening Graphic\" newspaper in New York City, where he was employed from 1924 to 1929.\nCommunist years.\nIn the fall of 1930 Walker joined the Communist Party, USA and assumed a position as a staff cartoonist for \"The Daily Worker,\" the party's New York City-based newspaper. In conjunction with his new role, Walker created a new regularly recurring character for his cartoons, a stolid proletarian known as Bill Worker.\nDeath and legacy.\nDuring a visit to the Soviet Union in the spring of 1932, Ryan Walker fell ill and was forced to be hospitalized. He died of pneumonia at Rotkinsky hospital in Moscow on June 22, 1932. He was 61 years old at the time of his death.\n\n"}

Since creating their first channel (DhoomBros) in 2008, their videos have gathered over 9 million combined views, including videos from their more recent channel (TheDhoomBros) made in 2012. They are particularly known for their satirical takes on everyday Desi lives, parodies of mainstream entertainment, video blogs, short films, and their Mehndi dance performances.\nCareer.\n2008–11: Early beginnings and background.\nThe DhoomBros are a four-member Pakistani-American group that includes \"Hussain Asif\", \"Shehryaar Asif\", \"Atif Khan\", and \"Waqas Riaz\" and they are based in the United States of America. The idea of calling themselves \"DhoomBros\" came within the name itself: “Dhoom” Bros (\"Dhoom\" = \"Blast\" in Hindi). The song “\"Dhoom Again\"”, from the 2006 Bollywood film Dhoom 2 was a popular hit amongst South Asians but the Western world was generally unaware of it. Brothers Shehryaar (informally known as \"Shehry\") and Hussain Asif performed to that song in a school talent show and received recognition from their peers and the school faculty. At this point, they called themselves the DhoomBros. This motivated them to entertain people through dance and various acts and so on June 23, 2008, the DhoomBros officially created their first YouTube channel (DhoomBros) and their official Facebook page. Atif Khan, the group's mutual friend, and Waqas Riaz, the cousin of the Asif brothers, joined later because they had similar interests.\nThey Started Off Making videos such as \"Jimmy And Saleem' and \"The Desi Mobsta Show\". They also would upload videos of themselves talking about weird things that have happened to them throughout their week, either at home,at school, or in daily life. \nWhen they started out they had nicknames, Hussain was, \"Desi Mobsta\" or \"Don\". Waqas was \"Daku\", Shehryaar was just \"Shehry\".\nNow, Hussain has a refurbished nickname \"Hussain Superstar\", Atif is \"Ati\" or \"Khan Saab\".\n2012–2013.\nIn 2012, DhoomBros videos became more frequent from \"Stuff Pakistanis Say\", a video that comically represents common Pakistani household events and phrases, to \"Humsafar Best Scenes Parody\", a parody based on the Pakistani drama serial, Humsafar, to the \"Annoying Brown Girls/Guys\" series, videos that show banter that stereotypical Desi teenagers seem to portray.\nIn October 2012, their popularity increased after the DhoomBros released their video, \"Desi Style\", a parody based on South Korean pop artist Psy's hit single, Gangnam Style. The DhoomBros chant in English, Urdu and Punjabi about their everyday Desi American lives, consisting of waking up to their mother’s voice, going to school, and greeting their grandfather, all accompanied with song and dance.\nThe group also experiment outside comical videos. \"Blessings of Ramadan\" is a video portraying three young men who indulge in materialistic aspects of their lives and fall astray from their spirituality by forgetting the significance of the month of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting and prayer. In addition, \"The Perfect Memory\" is the DhoomBros' first short film about the unexpected sacrifices one may have to make when it comes to love. Both videos were unlike the group's usual comical parodies, but were still well-garnered by audiences.\nTwo of the members, Shehryaar Asif and Waqas Riaz, are known for uploading occasional video blogs that highlight various aspects of the lives of the DhoomBros, such as showing sneak peeks of their projects and being DJs at work. They also document their trips, such as to different cities in the United States of America and their stay in Pakistan.

He had considered New York, Paris, and Singapore, but chef Joël Robuchon suggested London to him. The move took three years to organise.\nThe interior of the restaurant, designed by the Takenaka Corporation, features a counter made from 200-year-old cypress wood gifted to Araki by Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. That counter is divided from the kitchen by a pair of green curtains, and the overall look of the interior is based upon the architecture of the Japanese Edo period. There are only fifteen seats – nine at the counter and six in a private dining room. The restaurant formed part of a £250 million redevelopment of the combined office and retail space at Burlington Street.\nFare.\nThe restaurant offers a single choice of a set menu consisting of eleven courses, with two sittings taking place each evening. Araki has modified the style of sushi he has made to take into account European produce, such as salmon sushi, Cornish squid, and langoustines. Other dishes include similar designs to those he used at his previous restaurant, but from sources within Europe, such as his signature tuna sashimi, in which he serves three different cuts of the fish.\nReception.\nChef Jason Atherton called the food at The Araki \"mind blowing\" and said that it was as good as any restaurant in Japan.

It examines a conflict between the agricultural producers and the government that occurred in Argentina in 2008.\nThe conflict erupts when the producers, grouped in four employers' organizations, rejected the system of mobile retention to the exports of soy and sunflower established by the Resolution 125. In the new system quotas were replaced by an agreeable pricing standard where the percentage of compensation was equal to or greater than the international pricing standards of the product. One of the arguments was over an alleged fault regarding the Executive Powers ability to implement the measure.\nThe Argentine National Congress established the new system, finalizing the dispute on 17 July 2008.\nThe film presents the opinions of the philosopher Ricardo Forster, the journalist and economist Alfredo Zaiat and the graduate in communication Mariana Moyano.\nProduction.\nThe director declared that the idea of the film was born on April 1, 2008 when he decided to cover an act by President Fernández of Kirchner in support of this resolution.

The film stars Juliet Stevenson, Max von Sydow, Rutger Hauer and Priya Darshini. It was produced by Colin Azzopardi, Tony Cordeaux, and Lisa Riead. It was released theatrically by Freestyle Releasing on December 4, 2015.\nPlot.\nMother Teresa (Juliet Stevenson), recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, is considered one of the greatest humanitarians of modern times. Her selfless commitment changed hearts, lives and inspired millions throughout the world. The film is told through personal letters she wrote over the last forty years of her life and reveal a troubled and vulnerable woman who grew to feel an isolation and an abandonment by God. The story is told from the point of view of a Vatican priest (Max von Sydow) charged with the task of investigating acts and events following her death. He recounts her life’s work, her political oppression, her religious zeal, and her unbreakable spirit.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nRiead began exploring ideas for an inspirational and uplifting film just before the devastating terror attacks of September 11, 2001, forced a realization on him that would come to define his project. “I didn’t know there was that kind of evil in this world until then,” says Riead. “The attacks really brought that home.\"\n\"The Letters\" became a labor of love for Riead during the fourteen years it would take to produce the film. The turning point for Riead was the discovery of a startling cache of heartfelt, formerly confidential letters written by Mother Teresa to her spiritual advisor, the Belgian Jesuit priest Celeste van Exem, over a nearly 50-year correspondence. In her letters, some of which have been published in the 2007 book \"Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light\", Teresa revealed a crisis of faith that left her doubting God’s belief in her dedication to the poor. Riead read all of the letters that were available to the public and decided that they would make up the spine of his screenplay.\nCasting.\nWhen the time came to cast the film, Riead had a wealth of actresses clamoring to don Mother Teresa’s habit. To play her confessor, Father van Exem, Riead cast Max von Sydow, the Swedish star who has been a favorite of directors ranging from Ingmar Bergman to Martin Scorsese. When von Sydow asked the director for some insight into the character, Riead gave him a simple but telling answer. “I said, the whole world looked up to Mother Teresa,” he recalls. “And Mother Teresa looked up to Father van Exem. He just looked at me for a long moment, and he said, ‘got it.’ And that was it. He showed up and knew exactly what to do.”\nTo portray the nuns and students of the Loreto Convent, the Bishop of Calcutta, Mother Teresa’s wealthy benefactors, and the residents of the poverty stricken slums, Riead cast professional actors from India’s Bollywood film industry, considered the largest in the world.\nFilming.\nThe film was shot primarily in India, with interiors shot in Goa and second unit filming taking place in Calcutta, Delhi, and Mumbai. The scenes featuring Max von Sydow and Rutger Hauer (as van Exem’s confidant, Father Benjamin Praagh), were shot in a 15th-century London monastery.\nRelease.\n\"The Letters\" premiered at the Sedona Film Festival in February 2014. It was released theatrically in 886 venues on December 4, 2015.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Letters\" has received generally negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 30%, based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. The consensus states: \"\"The Letters\" tries to honor Mother Teresa with an unstintingly positive portrayal of her life and works, but ends up smothering a fascinating real-life story under a bland hagiography.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 25 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". \nAt the Sedona Film Festival, the film won the Audience Favorite “Best of the Fest” Award, and the International Catholic Film Festival in Rome, where Riead was honored as Best Director and Juliet Stevenson as Best Actress.\n\n"}

It was built at the railway's expense using the 'cut and cover' method. Its sole purpose was to burrow beneath Haydock Colliery's tracks.\nHistory.\nOpened by the Liverpool, St Helens and South Lancashire Railway, as part of the Great Central Railway, it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line and station passed to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, being transferred to the London Midland Region later that year.\nThe line through the station was originally double track and the station had two platforms.

A short stretch from Ashton through the Haydock station site to a new Shell distribution depot was reinstated in 1968. This ceased being rail-served in 1983, whereafter the line was cut back to Lowton Metals' scrapyard at Ashton.

He developed an original structural approach to the texts, and discovered various types of textological structures in the classic Chinese culture. His method of graphic description of textual structures, providing simplicity and easy visualization, according to some researchers, reminds graphic methods of logical description such as Lambert's lines or Eiler's circles, as well as the implementation of graphic description in thermodynamics by Clapeyron.

Resulting from this connection, restoration projects in the St. Lucie River are the northernmost component of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.\nThe C-44 has been a source of contention since its construction in 1916.\nThere are three major structures along the C-44: the S-308 lock and dam structure; the S-153 structure; and S-80 lock and dam structure. The St. Lucie Canal (C-44) can be referred to as the St. Lucie Canal, C-44, C-44 Canal, or the Okeechobee Waterway. The C-44 has a drainage basin of 185 square miles.\nHistory.\nConstruction began on the St. Lucie Canal (C-44) in 1916 and was completed in 1924. The original purpose of the canal was to allow for an improved way to divert floodwaters from Lake Okeechobee. The canal was originally designed to flow into Manatee Pocket instead of the South Fork of the St. Lucie River.\nRecords indicate that people have been complaining about the impacts of the C-44 since the early 1950s.\nDescription.\nThe St. Lucie Canal (C-44) connects to Lake Okeechobee at Port Mayaca. The capacity for the St. Lucie Canal (C-44) is 8 feet and 9,000 cubic feet per second; the result of a the St. Lucie Canal (C-44) second deepening in 1949. In 1933, 16 fixed spillways were approved for construction to reduce shoaling.\nMajor Structures.\nS-308.\nThe S-308 lock and dam structure is located at the western end of the St. Lucie Canal (C-44) and connects to the shore of Lake Okeechobee.\nS-153.\nThe S-153 is designed to discharge into the St. Lucie Canal (C-44). The S-153 regulates water levels in the Levee 65 Borrow Canal The Levee 65 Borrow Canal is located on the edge of Lake Okeechobee and north of the St. Lucie Canal (C-44).\nS-80.\nThe S-80 structure is a lock and dam structure located at the eastern end of the St. Lucie Canal (C-44). This structure was completed in 1944.\nWater Flows.\nAccording to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the St. Lucie Canal (C-44) flows both east to the St. Lucie Estuary and west to Lake Okeechobee \"on about an equal basis.\"\nIn 1924, the original flow capacity was 5,000 cubic feet per second. \nIn 1937, the canal was deepened to 6 feet to provide a navigable passage to Lake Okeechobee, and the flow capacity is unknown to this author.\nIn 1949, the canal was deepened to 8 feet, which increased the flow capacity to 9,000 cubic feet per second.\nEnvironment.\nOne of the major problems resulting from C-44 is too much freshwater discharged from C-44 to the St. Lucie Estuary to control the water levels of Lake Okeechobee.\nEstuary Salinity.\nLarge discharges from Lake Okeechobee into C-44 cause salinity levels to drop rapidly, killing many species in the estuaries.\nTurbidity.\nHigh flow rates result in erosion and the transport of sediment into the estuary that can smother benthic habitats. The increased turbidity also results in sediment filling navigation channels.\nC-44 Basin.\nThe C-44 Basin is 117,000 acres. Drainage from these acres into the St. Lucie Canal also create water quality problems for the St. Lucie Estuary.\nNavigation.\nIn 1937, the St. Lucie Canal (C-44) was deepened to 6 feet.\nThe St. Lucie Canal (C-44) connects to the Caloosahatchee Waterway, which connects Lake Okeechobee to the Gulf of Mexico at Fort Myers, Florida.\nTimeline.\n1916: Construction begins on St. Lucie Canal (C-44).\n1924: Original construction is completed, providing a flow capacity of 5,000 cubic feet per second.\n1937: the St. Lucie Canal (C-44) was deepened to 6 feet to allow for vessel navigation to and from Lake Okeechobee. 1949: the canal was deepened to 8 feet, which increased the flow capacity to 9,000 cubic feet per second.\n\n"}

Enrolled member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and advocate for local grass roots Tribal and community economic development. \nProfessional Background\nAfter serving in the US Navy as a young man, Raines has settled into his grandfather’s footsteps as a Native businessman and advocate for Native American social issues. Raines has been in the financial and insurance industry since 2000 and has been working towards economic development specific to Indian Country since 2005.\nEarly in his career Raines focused on personal finance for individual Native Americans. Specifically, on programs which focus on Native American health care, insurance, retirement, and long term care with Retirement Protection Strategies, Inc. The company provided financial planning for in Native American communities, with the goal of bringing self-reliance to Native American communities through a combination of traditional strategies and modern business concepts.\nUnder the mentorship of many well-known leaders in Tribal economic development and finance, such as financier Valerie Red Horse and attorney Dennis Ickes, Raines transitioned away from personal finance to tribal finance and economic development. Developing expertise in a variety of tribal economic development vehicles such as Tribal Section 17 corporations, Tribal Economic Development Bonds, and federal 8(a) contracting preferences.\nRaines served a Project Director for Nations Business Group, a business development firm located in Washington, DC lead then by tribal business leader Pete Homer. Raines was an advocate of the firm’s regional development model that worked with local tribal businesses to identify new revenue streams, and to obtain federal contracts though the SBA 8(a) program, backed with partnerships from major corporations.\nIn 2012 Raines decided to take his unique set of Tribal economic development skills back to his father’s reservation, the Pine Ridge\nIndian Reservation, and work more directly on tribal community economic development. Raines lives in the Wakpamni Lake Community on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and serves as an economic development consultant to the local tribal municipal government.\nPersonal Background \nBorn on October 23, 1975 in Salem, Oregon and raised primarily in Juneau, Alaska where his mother worked for the Indian Health Service. All four of Raines’s grandparents were teachers at the Chemewa Indian School in Oregon, where his parents subsequently met. Raines’s mother, Elizabeth Coburn, was born to Blackfeet (Margaret Pepion) and Klamath (Joseph Francis Coburn) parents, and is now with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Raines’s father, William Clifford Ballard, was born to Oglala Sioux (Evelyn Clifford) and Cherokee (John K. Ballard) parents, and currently with the Indian Health Service (IHS).\nRaines was greatly influenced by his grandparents and elders who served as tribal chairmen, council members, and Native entrepreneurs and business leaders. His grandmother’s sister, Eloise Cobell, (of the $3.4 billion Cobell settlement) helped encourage and guide him towards his efforts in economic development. His maternal grandfather Joseph Coburn was a Klamath tribal chairman and helped lead the restoration of the Klamath tribe.\nRaines was predominately raised by his mother, step-father Chris Rummell, and maternal grandparents. A strained relationship with his birth father eventually led to Raines changing his surname. Raines’ is also a member of the Blue Bird family of the Wakpamni Lake Community.\nCriticism.\nRaines was under scrutiny when he began pursuing online payday lending as a means of bringing in more money for the Pine Ridge Reservation. However, many members of the Wakpamni Native American community feel the negative attention towards Raines is a fear campaign, because the tribe is attempting new economic strides. While a lawsuit was filed and an initial judgment was awarded to the Black Hills Sioux Nation Treaty Council on January 18, 2015, the judgment and restraining order were subsequently reversed and dropped on June 28, 2015 and formal apologies were issued to Raycen Raines and his partners (Docket # CIV-11-0359K of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Court). \n\n"}

A percussive intro yields to an explosion of twinkling guitars and a chorus of woozy backing vocals. The core elements of Beach House's sound-- the drum machine, the thrift store keyboards-- are still present; they're just a few ticks faster. This makes a big difference. As it turns out, Beach House goes from dour to exuberant in just a few BPM.\" Leitko continues by saying, \"Legrand, whose vocals have been saddled with Nico comparisons, can finally breathe a sigh of relief, too. The 1960s chanteuse's shadow is nowhere to be found here. 'You let us in the wooden house/ To share in all the wealth,' sings Legrand over a carsick slide guitar riff. No, 'Norway' is radiant with the sunshiny 70s pop vibes. It's Stevie Nicks territory, for sure. Climate change has come to Beach House, and the weather suits them beautifully.\"\n\n"}

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48128036","title":"I-70 Killer","body":"\nI-70 Killer\n\nThe I-70 killer is an unidentified American serial killer who is known to have killed six store clerks in the Midwest in the spring of 1992. His nickname derives from the fact that several of the stores in which his victims worked were located a few miles off of Interstate 70 (I-70).\nHis victims were usually young, petite, brunette women. One of his victims was a man but he is believed to have mistaken the man for a woman as he often wore a ponytail. All of the stores attacked were speciality stores and were usually only robbed of a few hundred dollars. He is also suspected of shooting 3 more store clerks in Texas during 1993 and 1994, one of whom survived.\nDespite the case being featured on Unsolved Mysteries and Dark Minds, the killer has yet to have been identified and investigators have not publicly identified any suspects.\n1992 murder spree.\nThe killing spree began on April 8, 1992 with the murder of 26-year-old Payless ShoeSource manager Robin Fuldauer in Indianapolis. She was alone at the time of being shot and was murdered sometime between 1:30 and 2:00 p.m.\nThe next two murders occurred on April 11 at the La Bride d’Elegance bridal shop in Wichita. The victims were Patricia Smith, 23 and the store's owner, 32-year-old Patricia Majors. As this was the only case involving multiple victims, investigators believe the killer thought there was only one woman in the store. The women had stayed past normal closing time of 6 p.m. to allow a male customer to pick up a cummerbund. Sometime after 6 p.m., the women allowed the killer into the store, thinking he was the customer. After the women were murdered, the actual customer arrived to pick up the cummerbund and came to face-to-face with the I-70 killer. The I-70 killer let the man go,\nwho immediately notified police once the killer left. He would later provide details for a composite sketch.\nOn April 27, Michael McCown, 40, was killed in his mother Sylvia's ceramics store in Terre Haute, Indiana. McCown was the only man killed during spree and it is believed by investigators that the I-70 killer mistook him for a woman because of the store's name and because McCown wore a ponytail\nOn May 4, 24-year-old Nancy Kitzmiller was killed while working alone at Boot Village, a footwear shop in St. Charles, Missouri. She opened up the shop at noon and was found dead by customers at 2:30 p.m.\nThe final confirmed murder occurred on May 7 in Raytown, Missouri. The victim was 37-year-old Sarah Blessing who was working in her gift shop, Store of Many Colors. The murder occurred during the day, and the owner of video store next to the Kitzmiller's shop saw the killer enter the shop, heard a pop, and saw the killer leave. He then discovered Blessing's body after checking to see what had occurred in the store. A clerk at a nearby grocery store also saw the killer and saw him climbing a hill towards I-70 after the murder.\nPossible murders in Texas.\nInvestigators believe the I-70 killer may be responsible for two murders in 1993, and an attempted murder in 1994, all of which occurred in Texas. The two murder victims were 51-year-old Mary Ann Glasscock, who was killed on September 25, 1993 in Fort Worth at the Emporium Antiques store, and 22-year-old Amy Vess, who was shot dead in a dance apparel store in Arlington on November 1.\nThe surviving victim was Vicki Webb, 35, who was shot on January 15, 1994 in Houston at the Alternatives gift shop. She briefly talked to the shooter before he shot her in the back of the head. The bullet did not penetrate into Webb's head due to a large vertebra being hit. The shooter attempted to shoot her again, but his gun misfired, and left presuming Webb to be dead.\nThe modus operandi of the Texas killer was very similar to the I-70 killer and used a .22-caliber firearm, the same caliber as the I-70 killer. However, ballistics test determined that gun used in the Texas murders was not the same as the one used in the I-70 killings, so investigators have not been able to confirm that the I-70 killer was responsible for the shootings in Texas.\nInvestigation.\nThe murders were conclusively linked after a St. Charles detective suspected a connection. All of the murders were committed with a .22-caliber firearm and the victims were usually petite, young women with long dark hair. Aside from the Wichita murders, all the victims were alone while murdered and shot in the back of the head. None of the scenes had any signs of sexual assault and while all stores were robbed, robbery appeared to be a secondary motive as all the stores were small speciality stores, which would not have had as much money as larger stores.\nBased on witness testimonies, police strongly believe the murder weapon may have been an Intratec Scorpion pistol or an Erma Werke ET22 pistol, however they have not been able to rule out any other .22-caliber firearm models. The ammunition used in the killings was .22-caliber CCI copper-clad lead bullets. The cartridges of the bullets had been polished with jeweler's rouge.\nMidwest authorities linked the killer to the shootings in Texas in 1994, but Texas authorities were not convinced of a connection as different guns were used in each spree.\nBased on witness descriptions, investigators were able to produce to two composite sketches of the killer and a physical description of the suspect. The I-70 killer was described as being a white man in his twenties or thirties, 5'7\" (1.70 m) to 5'9\" (1.75 m) tall, thin and having lazy eyelids and sandy blond or reddish hair in 1992. If he still alive, he would be in his fifties or late forties.\nPolice have not publicly identified any suspects and the case has been classified as a cold case.\nPopular culture.\nThe case has been featured on \"Unsolved Mysteries\" and Investigation Discovery's \"Dark Minds\".\n\n"}

The land where the town currently sits belonged to La Hacienda De La Concepcion. The village is the point of intersection of the paths that lead to Acuitzio, Etucuaro, Curuchancio and Tacambaro, this is why it became known as Cruz De Caminos (Cross Roads).\nCruz De Caminos, was in 1901 part of Acuitzio Del Canje.

On October 12, 1914, the agreement to raise it to a municipality with the name of Madero was ratified.\nIn present time, Villa Madero is becoming famous due to a great festival named \"La Feria del Mezcal\". This is about a traditional beverage \"mezcal\" produced in Etucuaro, a town that is part of the Madero municipality. During this festival, producers give free samples of their product.

What sets \"Myth\" as another sonic evolution for Beach House, then, is all in the details.\" Fitzmaurice continues by saying, \"The layers of echo surrounding Legrand's voice during its chorus, as well as the gauzy glow wrapped around everything, give the impression that the airy expansiveness of 2010's Teen Dream has contracted, but somehow the sound is just as \"big\", if not bigger, than before. \"What comes after this momentary bliss?\" Legrand croons at one point.

{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48128318","title":"Moyer's Landfill","body":"\nMoyer's Landfill\n\nMoyer's Landfill was a privately owned landfill in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, United States. It was originally farmland outside the town. In the 1940s the owner started accepting trash and municipal waste as a way to make additional money. The original landfill was 39 acres and did not have a liner to protect the land from contaminate. A liner was added to a new section in the late 1970s. Over time, the landfill accepted sewage, and industrial wastes which contained hazardous substances in addition to municipal waste. The site was closed by the EPA in 1981, and was one of the first \"Superfund\" sites added to the National Priorities List.\nHistory.\nThe Site had been operating as a municipal landfill from the early 1940s until April 1981. The landfill accepted municipal waste, sewage, and a variety of solid and liquid hazardous wastes (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), products containing dioxin, paint solvents, and similar material). The original landfill was a section of the farm with no liner to prevent material from seeping into the soil. In the original landfill any waste was simply dumped and covered with dirt.\nIn 1972 when the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection () rules became more restrictive, the site was cited for violations. To achieve compliance, pipes were added to drain leachate to two earthen basins which were pumped into trucks for treatment and disposal. Due to leakage from the basins, the system was modified to pump all the leachate to a concrete basin where it was sprayed over the top of the landfill.\nIn the late 1970s, the landfill owners submitted a request to enlarge the landfill which was granted. Work started to enlarge the landfill in 1977, and included an asphalt liner to protect the soil from hazardous materials. Dumping was reportedly limited to this new area from 1977 to early 1981.\nBefore remediation, contaminants were spread by rain water soaking into the landfill, some of which may have reached the ground water. Run-off from the landfill also carried contaminates to local streams (Skippack Creek and Perkiomen Creek).\nLocal residents tried for years to get the landfill closed. In the late 1970s 450 families united to try to close what they called \"Mount Trashmore\". They packed the local zoning board meetings, wrote letters to several environmental protection agencies, and had lawn signs printed up to close the dump.\nIn the lawsuit \"O'LEARY v. Moyer's Landfill, Inc., 523 F. Supp. 642 (E.D. Pa. 1981)\" it states \"this suit was brought in part because DER has, in plaintiffs' view, been ineffective in alleviating the dangers plaintiffs perceive at the landfill\".\nThe site was finally closed by the PA DEP in early 1981.\nExtent of the contamination.\nAnalysis of the leachate dates back to 1972, this analysis was conducted to design an aerated lagoon to treat the liquid. After being designated a Superfund site, tests found heavy metals and organic chemicals. These chemicals included Benzene, toluene, Trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and chlorobenzene. All of which are associated with industrial solvents. Samples from the landfill had a total of 86 priority pollutants and 16 metals. Water samples were taken from the Skippack and Perkiomen Creeks and chemicals found in the landfill were also found in both streams. A remediation study was funded at a total cost of $681,000\nThe result of the remediation survey in 1985 an estimate was made that the cost of a cleanup would be $15 million and an additional $340,000 a year for operation and maintenance. By 1994 the price tag has been increased to $45 million for the cleanup.\nCompletion.\nOn May 27, 2014 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) region III removed Moyer's Landfill from the National Priorities List. The site is no longer considered a Superfund site. The site consists of open land surrounded by trees on steep slopes. The landfill is fenced off and has leachate collection tanks. There are no development plans.\n\n"}

Some of the child actors used in the film were sourced through local churches, and none had a previous professional acting experience. Before the commencement of principal photography, the director, Babatope had got the child actors on film set to play around, in order to desensitize them to the cameras, dollies, cables, lights and the peculiarities of filming environment.\nOnset photos for \"Lunch Time Heroes\" was released to the public online in March 2015. Trailer for the film was released in July 2015. It premiered at FilmHouse Cinema, Surulere, Lagos on 23 August 2015; with general theatrical release on 28 August 2015. The theme soundtrack for the film, titled \"I Believe\" by Capital Femi, was released online on 28 August 2015, along with its music video, which features the casts of the film.\nCritical reception.\nThe film has been met with mixed critical reception. Amarachukwu Iwuala of \"360Nobs\" commends the film's screenplay, character development and soundtrack, but criticizes the film for having several inconsistencies in its storytelling. She concludes: \"Much as the story of \"Lunch Time Heroes\" is foreseeable, owing to the title of the film and the information on the promotional materials, one nevertheless enjoys the journey that leads to the final destination\". Yvonne Anoruo praises the soundtrack, but notes the lack originality, and several inconsistencies. She comments: \"\"Lunch Time Heroes\" comes with a very simple plot, and with very predictable twists and turns. It is so focused on staying true to its subject matter and with rather rigid dialogues that it is altogether stiff. At the end of it, one realises that save a few characters, the others are largely flat. There were a lot of improvisations in measures that takes away from the movie. The final product does not elicit any feelings beyond the ordinary and if any, it totters on the edge of basic. Ultimately, for what it lacks everywhere else, the movie makes up for with very adorable child actors\". Jite Efemuaye comments: \"\"Lunch Time Heroes\" is a good effort which is undermined by a less than dedicated attention to detail on the director’s part. Even with all its limitations, it is an entertaining movie, one that can be enjoyed by all members of the family, but it is easily forgettable\". Yvonne Williams of \"Nollywood Observer\" comments: \"Although \"Lunch Time Heroes\" wows with its uncommon storyline and brilliant performances from Dakore Akande and Tina Mba, it falls short in its delivery – somewhat un-contagious forced humour, thinness of the plot, overacting amongst other things. However, it no doubt would be a welcome delight for the youth and the young at heart\".\n\n"}

He was again Minister of Industry and Commerce from 1945 to 1951.\nEarly years (1891–1936).\nJuan Antonio Suanzes Fernández was born in Ferrol, Coruña, on 20 May 1891.\nHe was the oldest of six children in a family with naval traditions.\nHis father, Saturnino Sunazes Carpegna, belonged to the General Corps of the navy.\nHe attended a religious school for his early education.\nAt the age of 12 he entered the naval school in Ferrol.\nHe was promoted to midshipman (1906), frigate ensign (1908) and navy Ensign (1909).\nAt times he was assigned to ships such as the \"Numancia\", \"Pelayo\", \"Carlos V\" and \"Reina Regente\".\nIn 1913 he was appointed as a lieutenant to the battleship \"España\".\nIn 1915 Suanzes began to study naval engineering in Ferrol.\nIn 1917 he was a captain of naval engineers, and a teacher at the Naval Military School of San Fernando in Cadiz.\nIn 1920 he was named director of the Cartagena shipyard of the \"Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval\" (SECN, Spanish Society of Naval Construction).\nHe was appointed commander of engineers in 1921.\nIn 1922 he was made a supernumerary of the navy so he could devote himself to his work for the private company.\nHe was in charge of the SECN shipyard at Cartagena until 1926, then was transferred to run the shipyard in Ferrol. In January 1932 he moved to Madrid with his family.\nIn Madrid he was Inspector General of Construction for the company.

In 1984, he received his Juris Doctor from the Yale Law School and his MBA from the Yale School of Management. At the Yale Law School, he was the co-founder and Editor-in-Chief of the \"Yale Journal on Regulation\" and a Senior Editor of the \"Yale Law Journal\".\nCareer.\nJudson started his career as a consultant and founding member of the New York office of the Boston Consulting Group. In 1989, Judson joined Time Inc. Magazines, where he was appointed the Company’s first corporate Director of Marketing. After the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications led to the creation of Time Warner Inc., Judson’s corporate marketing department served as the focal point for Time Warner’s initiative to provide advertisers with advertising programs, involving entities throughout the media conglomerate.\nLater, with the creation of Time Inc. New Media, Judson was appointed General Manager, where he was one of the co-founders of the Pathfinder (website). Walter Isaacson, then President of Time Inc. New Media, and the subsequent biographer of Steve Jobs, credits Judson with inventing the concept of the Web banner ad, which established the standardized system that enabled the rapid growth of Internet advertising.\nWhile working at Time Inc. New Media, Judson wrote \"NetMarketing\", which became a nationwide bestseller, and was excerpted in \"Advertising Age\". He was named by \"Advertising Age\" as one of the nation’s \"Cybermarketing Leaders.\" Judson’s activities at Time Inc. New Media are described in Michael Wolff’s bestselling book, \"Burn Rate.\"\nAfter leaving Time Inc., Judson accepted an appointment at the Yale School of Management as a Faculty Fellow, and was later promoted to Senior Faculty Fellow. At Yale, he developed and taught a clinical course offering free consulting to small businesses. Judson also served as one of the founding faculty members of the Yale Publishing Course, and as the first entrepreneur-in-residence at the Yale Entrepreneurial Institute.\nIn 1999, Scribner published, \"HyperWars\" which Judson co-authored. The book asserted that significant changes in corporate strategies would be required for success in the coming Internet era. \"HyperWars\" was selected by Soundview Executive Book Summaries as one of the best business books published in the year of its release.\nIn 2004, HarperBusiness published Judson’s book, \"Go it Alone!\" which argued that the combination of software-as-a-service, automation, and outsourcing, enabled by the Internet would fundamentally alter the nature of entrepreneurship and small business success. In the book, Judson also asserted that as a result of automated leverage created by the Internet, small groups of people or individuals, working on their own, would be able to build high revenue businesses. The book was recognized by \"Library Journal\" as one of the best business books published in the year of its release, while Judson’s ideas on the future of entrepreneurship were the subject of dedicated interviews in business publications, such as \"The Wall Street Journal\"and \"Entrepreneur\" magazine.\nJudson later partnered with HarperBusiness, to test the value of making the full text of \"Go It Alone!\" available free online, with advertising support. This first-of-its-kind effort in book publishing was featured in a \"US News and World Report\" cover story.\nIn 2012, the continuing significance of the ideas in \"Go It Alone\" was recognized by \"Entrepreneur\" magazine, which dedicated a feature story to the book, and its continuing popularity, at a time when the \"half-life of business books\" is short, while the website LifeHack recommended the book, twelve years after its initial publication, in a May 2016 article.\nWhile involved at Yale and writing books, Judson was also active in developing independent businesses, including Web-Clipping (co-founder), (an early online news clipping service for businesses), the business broadband marketplace Speed Anywhere., and a mobile Web site development firm.\nJudson's book, \"It Could Happen Here\", was published in 2009 by HarperCollins. The book argued that growing and extreme economic inequality in the United States was a societal danger. Judson worked with historical and social science research to construct a model which indicated that highly unequal societies are characterized by political polarization, anger, lack of trust, political paralysis, a collapsing middle class and potentially political instability. The book appeared two years before Occupy Wall Street led economic inequality to be considered a mainstream political issue, and at the time the significance of growing economic inequality was often disregarded or seen as unlikely to continue.\nJudson was subsequently appointed a Braintruster at the Roosevelt Institute, where he launched a column titled \"Restoring Capitalism\" for the Institute’s website. Articles from the column were syndicated in online media including \"The Business Insider\" and \"The Huffington Post\".\nAs of December 2015, Judson is a Senior Adviser to Tern Plc.\n\n"}

Back then part of the Sanjak of Scutari of the Ottoman Empire, Tirana was already flourishing as an oriental-style town. Haxhi Ymer was a sheikh (Sufi leader) of the Qadiri order of Sufism, a less spread order going towards extinction in Albania. Most of his work is lost because of earlier lack of interest in him. His name Haxhi indicates that he had completed his hajj in Mecca. He used the pen name Suzi. The outer facade of the portal of Et'hem Bey Mosque in Tirana has an inscription written by him with his pen-name as signature.\nHaxhi Ymer was a \"bejte\" poet who wrote in two languages: Albanian and Turkish. From a few odes that are saved to date, one is of special interest. It is named \"Alif\" and it is one of a kind due to the specific structure it introduced to Albanian poetry of those times. The poem is based on the letters of the Arabic alphabet and thus has 28 verses, each verse starts with a unique letter in alphabetic order. The first starts with \"alif\" and the last with \"yā’\". This type of verse introduced by Haxhi Ymer became a tradition in Albanian poetry and had many followers.\nThough heavily laden with Oriental vocabulary, his work has linguistic significance due to the specific Tirana area Gheg dialect of the Albanian language (part of the Central Gheg branch), being the oldest written piece in this dialect.\n\n"}

She is credited with having built the first modern, national art gallery in the Balkans.\nBiography.\nVictoria Angelova was born on 20 November 1902 in Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria to Vasil Angelov, a merchant who had been educated in England. He named his daughter after Queen Victoria in homage. She graduated from the Vienna University of Technology and the Dresden Polytechnic. At the age of 24, she returned to Sofia and was working as an intern at the Ministry of Public Works when she won a contest for her first major commission. In 1933, Angelova married a fellow architect, Boris Vinarov and they set up a practice in Sofia. \nAngelova worked during a period when most public projects were awarded after competitions which were open nationally. She designed buildings throughout the country, but is primarily known for those in Sofia. She was awarded the Order of Civil Merit for her architectural contributions to the country. In 1944, the couple's home was bombed and they lost many of their personal effects, including their architectural drawings. They evacuated to Turnovo, where Angelova became ill with a severe case of pneumonia. Believing she had recovered, they returned to Sophia in 1946, but Angelova relapsed and died on 27 December 1947. Her husband died three months later.\nSelected projects.\nMinistry of Public Buildings, Roads and Public Works.\n The ministry held a contest in 1926 for designs of a new office building for the Ministry of Public Buildings, Roads and Public Works. Although Angelova won the contest, she was required to have the experienced architects and Yordan Yordanov () oversee her work. The building covered an entire city block known as \"Slaveykov Square\" and was bounded by \"GS Rakovski\", \"William Gladstone\" and \"Han Krum \" streets. Construction began in 1928 and was completed four years later.\nThe design was Neoclassical and featured towering marble columns and mosaic floor tiles. Flanking the entrance were two statues, one female figure representing architecture and one male figure representing construction, as well as three stone heads in altorilievo adorning the doorways. The sculptures were completed by Mikhail Ivanov, Stephen Peychev and . The wide corridors and high ceilings are offset by stained glass designed by and made in Munich by F. Seiler. Today it houses the Metropolitan Library and the \"Renaissance Theater\" on one side and several doctors' and dentists' offices on the other.\nNational Art Gallery.\nFrom 1934 to 1941, Angelova worked on the National Art Gallery. The building was completed in 1942 and opened featuring a first floor which housed Renaissance paintings by Stanislav Dospevski, Nikolai Pavlovich, Hristo Tsokev, Zahari Zograf, as well as handcrafts from regions noted for folk artworks, such as Tryavna, Samokov and others. The second floor focused on contemporary Bulgarian art featuring painters and sculptors from the early 20th century. When completed, the building was recognized as the first modern, national art gallery in the Balkans. It was bombed in 1944 and completely destroyed, along with its contents, which included the complete works of leading Bulgarian sculptor \nSea Casino of Burgas.\n In 1936, Atanas Sirekov, the mayor of Burgas, initiated a design contest for a casino on Burgas Bay. Seventeen architects competed and Angelova won with a design she called \"333\". The building required a complex design due to the steep slope of the site and its panoramic view of the entire gulf area. Completed in 1938, the inauguration was attended by dignitaries from throughout the country, who received a special travel discount of 70% off the price of train tickets to attend. The building was abandoned in the late 1990s, but after almost 20 years of neglect, was restored and opened as a cultural center in 2011. The renovation project won the “Building of the Year” award for 2011.\nRaduntsi Lung Hospital.\nIn 1937 after a lengthy study had taken place, an act was passed for the construction of a tubercular sanatorium in the village of . The Pulmonary Hospital was to be the largest facility of its kind in the Balkans and located 650 meters above sea level. Angelova won the contract for the construction of the hospital and building was to begin shortly before World War II started. Ground was broken in 1939, but in 1940 after four stories were built, further construction was suspended until after the war ended. Construction resumed on 9 September 1944 but was not completed until 1955, nearly a decade after Angelova's death. The first patients were received at the hospital on 1 November 1955. Financial problems which began in 2013, forced the closure of the hospital in 2015.\n\n"}

Their role was to guard and oversee the work of the prisoners transported to Western Australia.\nIn common with many of the Enrolled Pensioner Guards, Gailey was Irish and Catholic. He was born in Old Ross County in Watford in 1807. In December 1825, at the age of 18 years, he enlisted in the British Army, serving as a private in the 18th Regiment. He served for 20 years and was discharged in September 1846. He was 39 years of age. His record indicates his character was \"extremely good\" and he was awarded three good conduct badges. He was described as in height, with a fair complexion, grey eyes and hair dark. He married Margaret Hannen and in 1849 they had a son named John.\nIn 1851 Gailey and his family travelled with a number of other Pensioner Guards to the settlement of Toodyay, where they were temporarily housed in A-framed straw huts and allotted plots of land. These allotments were later transferred to the permanent Convict Hiring Depot, upstream of the town. Thirteen allotments, S1 to S13, were marked out, and from 1852 to 1856 two-roomed brick cottages were erected. The Gaileys, whose family had increased with the birth of two daughters, Anna in 1851 and Ellen in 1856, were allocated one of the first three cottages to be completed. The Depot became known as the Pensioner Village. Canon Raffaele Martelli, who had been appointed in 1855 by Bishop Salvado to look after Toodyay’s Catholic community, occupied one of the cottages for a short time.\nWhen more Pensioner Guard families arrived at the Depot, Martelli had to vacate the cottage and return to the townsite, where he was offered Gailey’s straw hut as temporary quarters. Martelli kept regular correspondence with Salvado and in one letter he thanks the bishop for sending a jar of butter that he wanted to give to Gailey. Martelli’s correspondence reveals a high regard for Gailey. \nIn 1858, Gailey and many other Enrolled Pensioner Guards in the colony contributed to the Indian Relief Fund that had been set up in England following the Indian Mutiny of 1857. Many of the EPGs had served in India with the British Army before their retirement. The mutiny led to the ending of the East India Company in 1858, and the establishment of the British Raj.\nIn 1860 the new town of Newcastle, located around the Convict Hiring Depot, had been surveyed. Gailey was allocated Lot S7 of , and purchased Lot 17 consisting of . This lot was located across the road from what became the Sisters of Mercy Convent, and at the southern end of Lot 17, the Roman Catholic St John the Baptist church was erected in 1863. Possibly around the same time a Catholic Presbytery was built across the road from the church on Lot S19.\nDuring the 1860s Gailey employed four ticket-of-leave men, conducted a small school, and worked as a bootmaker. He offered to take in the Quinlan children, Timothy (born February 1861) and his sister Mary when their mother died while giving birth to twins. Their father was up north with a government party at the time. When their father also died the children were placed with Joseph Thomas Reilly, a prominent Catholic newspaperman and active citizen, who raised them with his own children. Timothy Quinlan went on to become a prominent politician and husband to Daniel Connor's daughter Teresa.\nGailey continued to be a resident in Toodyay, dying on 18 April 1881.\n\n"}
