And opening the door to tweaking and expanding this feature in the future to better solve use cases that are slightly different from yours is not attractive to me either. \r\n\r\nI believe that the beauty of gulp plugins is that they are simple, unopinionated, imperative, and get incorporated into the workflow of your own code. Grunt, for example, encourages API creep within its plugins because they are used declaratively; they are simply configured. Gulp allows you to take micro-helpers and mix and match them in ways that conform to really specific workflow needs. If a gulp plugin begins to make assumptions about workflow, it has the opportunity for a quick expansion of complexity and/or a need for the plugin to be configured in more ways. \r\n\r\nI am of the opinion that more stupid-simple modules is better than fewer slightly more complex modules, especially in the gulp environment."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T01:00:10Z"}

In hypothetical terms, every person who wields an axe isnt always going to crack a skull open. A martial arts expert is hardly going to go into a full Celtic berserk are they?\r\nSo. My point is that there is no diversity. As you train up your skill you should be able to choose what you focus on when wielding your weapon. I'm proposing we add a progression system, which allows players to build upon a basic foundation of an ability. Using a point every 100 levels you should be able to build a \"ability specialisation\" that is unique to the player. I will use unarmed as an example;\r\nWhen your reach level 100 in unarmed you receive a small menu (possibly use the chest menu system?) from this you select a foundation perk, this gives you your beginning ability. Here's some ideas of unarmed abilities:\r\nForceful Kick. Ready your feet and deal astounding knock back damage to your foe.\r\nBerserk (changed). Ready your fists and enter a rage dealing more damage per hit though hitting slower.\r\nKneck Snap. Ready your hands as you approach your target, and if they are weak enough instantly put them to rest.\r\nDrunken Slugging. Ready your fists and enter a drunken state where you take less damage and deal a small amount more.\r\nClaws. Ready your hands as you tear at your enemy adding the bleed effect to them.\r\nLow Blow. Raise your foot and aim low, dazing your opponent.\r\n\r\nLets say I select Drunken Slugging. I cannot go back on that decision. Then I receive another menu giving me options into which aspect of drunken slugging I should focus on. My options would be:\r\nDrunken Resistance. Take less damage\r\nDrunken Bravery. Do slightly more damage\r\nDrunken belching. When fighting you belch causing a nausea effect to enemies around you.\r\n\r\nI would then gain more points every 100 levels to improve myself even more. These skills would cap at 1000 giving a varied result. Once completed you can rename your Technique for all to fear. This would be available for axe users and sword users to just different foundations.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading. Pls criticise / praise. Ask for more if you want it.\r\n-Regards CFLPlayer"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T01:00:25Z","org":{"id":1429663,"login":"mcMMO-Dev","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/mcMMO-Dev","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1429663?"}}

It seems quite stable, been using it for a few days (provided the configuration is correct, I suppose, didn't test what happens when ghc-modi is not correctly configured).\r\n\r\nI bound the type info call to the DocumentationProvider as well as to an action (alt - equals, like scala). I prefer the action, I think the documentation provider doesn't work so well. There are tests of the parsing of the output of ghc-modi, but not really of the documentationprovider, basically because of the abundance of static calls and the fact that I think they can only be mocked while testing, and statics can only be mocked through Powermock if I recall correctly, which would mean an extra test dependency and so on and so forth, so I left that to be your call.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a weird behaviour that getting the editor creates a stack trace of around 5 kilometers long, something that seems like a threading issue, but the function seems to work. I don't really know why the stack trace happens, all the more because it only happens when calling the type information through the documentation provider (same code path is used when the action is called, but no stack trace). Maybe you know more what could go wrong, it looks like something intellij-related.\r\n\r\nSo, consider this a \"request for comment\" more than a pull request

I did some experimenting and added print statements to `CommandThread` so I could see when threads were starting and finishing. Here's what I think is happening:\r\n> - When a commit is started, the plugin collects history and diffs and shows the commit buffer allowing the user to enter a commit message.\r\n> - The user then closes the buffer, starting the commit.\r\n> - At that moment, another buffer is activated (because the commit message buffer was closed) causing the GitBranchStatusCommand to run (statusbar.py)\r\n> - On these large repos, `git status --porcelain` does not finish until AFTER the `git commit` thread starts. `git status --porcelain` creates an index.lock file\r\n> The threads are running like this:\r\n> 1. Start status thread\r\n> 2. Start commit thread\r\n> 3. Finish commit (fails because status is still running)\r\n> 4. Finish status\r\n> Because `git status` creates an index.lock file, the commit fails. This doesn't affect me on small repos, I assume because `git status` runs much faster there. Sometimes `git status` runs fast enough even on large repos for this not to happen. I don't know what git is doing or why it's creating the lock file for a status.\r\n> I'm not sure how to resolve the issue. Perhaps just temporarily disable the GitBranchStatusListener listener during a commit (and then update the statusbar when the commit is finished). Or queue the commands.

Some comments on @narc0tiq 's thread about scrapes and bruises sort of gave me some ideas where I want this to go.\r\n(beep boop calling @KA101 because `u r mad dope son`)\r\n\r\nAny and ALL comments welcome!\r\n\r\n### Briefing\r\nMy first notion is to abstract the notion of underlying anatomical 'systems' into a class that can be derived from. In said class, any arbitrary number of arbitrary `groups` of `anatomical_parts` can be together. So if you have 2 legs, 2 hands, 2 arms, a sweet eye patch, a hangover, and no dignity; most of these can theoretically be listed in this class. I have setup the very basics of it, along with a notion of design (a modicum I assure you, not an overzealous person or anything). I plan on migrating to JSON loadable files so these 'parts' and 'groups' can be super *dope* and expanded upon easily. Each `anatomical_part` falls into one or more `anatomical_group`s . These groups I hope to be expandable with the help of either/both Lua or JSON, or black magic I ain't judgin'. \r\n\r\nSo parts fall into groups, groups can provide flags to what these parts do. For an example of the slice of my code thus far...\r\n\r\n```\r\nenum anatomical_function {\r\n    // motor functions\r\n    AF_AMBULATION = 0,                          /* orthostasis, ambulating, etc */\r\n    // five senses\r\n    AF_OCULAR,                                  /* sight */\r\n    AF_OLFACTORY,                               /* smell */\r\n    AF_AUDITORY,                                /* hearing */\r\n    AF_GUSTATORY,                               /* taste */\r\n    AF_TACTILE,                                 /* touch */\r\n    // circulatory\r\n    AF_RESPIRATORY,                             /* breathing */\r\n    AF_NEUROVASCULAR,                           /* nervous [+ vascular] system */\r\n    AF_CARDIOVASCULAR,                          /* heart & vascular system */\r\n    // chassis, engine, and driver\r\n    AF_SKELETAL,                                /* bones */\r\n    AF_MUSCULAR,                                /* as it says */\r\n    AF_NEUROLOGICAL,                            /* brain/nervous system */\r\n    // non-humanoid functions\r\n    AF_ANTENNAE,                                /* sensory perception via antennae */\r\n    num_af\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo with these `functions` lumped together with both `parts` and `groups`, you could have specific effects or diseases target these systems. \r\n\r\nOR MAYBE I AM OVERTHINKING THE `functions` PART A BIT, I DUNNO, BRAINSTORMING AND STUFF.\r\n\r\nSo what this roundabouts would look like further implemented, is things you have to watch for. Do you want to go into v-tach? *Nah dawg, you don't. So stop sniffing coke son.*\r\n\r\nBeen overdoing the stimulants for a fair amount, and have taken some cardiac damage? *You gun die son.*\r\n\r\nOh man, you have gone and broke that finger. *Guess you can't blap blap now.*\r\n\r\nHappen to have cut your fingertip too much with a knife, guess you goin'ta have some scar tissue son, *guess you are.*\r\n\r\nOkay so maybe it won't get _that_ crazy, but I would like a decently dynamic medical system, so it is more than just \"chug vitamins, don't do drugs, use first aid kit, done.\" Broken bones should be a reality before arm health reaches zero, more limbs and appendages should be a thing _anyway_ (hell maybe we could spin that off for mutated `anatomy`)! *GASP SON*\r\n\r\n# EAST COAST\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n- [ ] Implement `anatomy` for creatures/critters/players/space-monsters/etc.\r\n- [ ] JSONify the `anatomy` aspects a bit, so as to make adding new `parts` and whatnot is legit as hell.\r\n- [ ] Implement new UI to better fit how *baller* this update will be.\r\n- [x] Realize that I am mad baller and fly as hell. Damn you sexy. \r\n- [ ] ~~Play way too much Cataclysm~~ Implement vital signs (BP, MAP, O2%)\r\n\r\n<bountysource-plugin>\r\n\r\n---\r\nWant to back this issue? **[Place a bounty on it!](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/7315679-wip-medical-updates?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F146201&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github)** We accept bounties via [Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/?utm_campaign=plugin&utm_content=tracker%2F146201&utm_medium=issues&utm_source=github).\r\n</bountysource-plugin>"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/comments/68477285","html_url":"https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/10655#issuecomment-68477285","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/issues/10655","id":68477285,"user":{"login":"i2amroy","id":4275617,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4275617?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy","html_url":"https://github.com/i2amroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/i2amroy/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T01:03:36Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T01:03:36Z","body":"I think a lot of the feasibility of this design comes down to the nitty-gritty exact implementation level.

Since an IP or domain can be associated with multiple sources and campaigns, this approach allows you to delete an individual reference or to delete the entire record. If you provide a campaign and source along with the record ID, then this will just delete the references to that campaign and source. If you only provide the record ID, then it will delete the entire record.\r\n\r\nThe code for delete support in the domain API is a little complicated. The django-tastypie-mongoengine won't accept a DELETE request with parameters passed in the body of the request. Therefore, the DELETE request must pass the parameters in the URL. However, in order to pass the request to the generate_domain_jtable, the request must be converted into a POST format. Since I didn't know the jtable code well enough to reformat it, I got around the issue by creating a fake POST object and passing that instead. This isn't the most elegant solution but it allowed me to contain the changes to the API code.\r\n\r\nBeing able to delete an IP or API reference would be useful for people who want to use CRITs to track only the current list of threats. For instance, IPs are sometimes removed from IOC lists because the compromised host has been fixed. These changes would allow you to remove the IP from the current list of threats via the API. This code still requires the user to have admin privileges in order to perform the deletion.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at the code and let me know your thoughts.

try of the type information. It seems quite stable, been using it for a few days (provided the configuration is correct, I suppose, didn't test what happens when ghc-modi is not correctly configured).\r\n\r\nI bound the type info call to the DocumentationProvider as well as to an action (alt - equals, like scala). I prefer the action, I think the documentation provider doesn't work so well. There are tests of the parsing of the output of ghc-modi, but not really of the documentationprovider, basically because of the abundance of static calls and the fact that I think they can only be mocked while testing, and statics can only be mocked through Powermock if I recall correctly, which would mean an extra test dependency and so on and so forth, so I left that to be your call.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a weird behaviour that getting the editor creates a stack trace of around 5 kilometers long, something that seems like a threading issue, but the function seems to work. I don't really know why the stack trace happens, all the more because it only happens when calling the type information through the documentation provider (same code path is used when the action is called, but no stack trace). Maybe you know more what could go wrong, it looks like something intellij-related.\r\n\r\nSo, consider this a \"request for comment\" more than a pull request

We also already have apache running for horizon, so it could reduce number of services.    apache also has better logging options that haproxy which can only log to syslog.

We also already have apache running for horizon, so it could reduce number of services.    apache also has better logging options that haproxy which can only log to syslog.

We also already have apache running for horizon, so it could reduce number of services.    apache also has better logging options that haproxy which can only log to syslog.

This means that std::vector::insert in libCStd does\nnot accept a pair of iterators from a different type of container, because\nthat requires member templates, and reverse_iterator<const T> can not\nbe constructed from a reverse_iterator<T> because that requires partial\nspecialization (or at least the _RWSTD_NO_CLASS_PARTIAL_SPEC define) and\nmember templates.\n\nThis causes many problems while building CMake using SolarisStudio, which\nhave not been well understood until now.  The problems are usually\nattributed to compiler limitations, while actually the problem is in\nthe standard library, as in commit v3.0.0-rc1~99^2~1 (Help: Document non-use\nof std::set::insert., 2014-01-24) and commit 107dcac3 (Fix compilation with\nthe Oracle / Sun compiler (#15318), 2014-12-12).\n\nSolarisStudio 12.3 and earlier also ships a version of stlport which may be\nused instead of libCstd by specifying -library=stlport4\n\n https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18659_01/html/821-1383/bkakg.html\n\nSolarisStudio 12.4 ships a version of libstdc++ from GCC 4.8.2 which may be\nused by specifying -std=c++03 or -std=c++11 etc\n\n http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37069_01/html/E37075/bkamw.html#OSSCPgnaof\n\nUse these more-capable standard library implementations when building cmake.\nThis will allow more use of 'normal' C++ (such as std::vector::insert), and cause\nfewer surprises resulting from dashboards using SolarisStudio.\n\nBecause cmake is not a library linked against by 3rd parties and does not have\nexternal dependencies, issues related to mixing code using libCStd and libstdc++\ndo not apply.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kitware/CMake/commits/5e8b4a718169837db825538561ddfd85cf62be43"},{"sha":"be77679552dbda01d62b03a85de05ad7e7684862","author":{"email":"fbd1bb53ae91c7d21c5feb88facb5fbef8543d8e@gmail.com","name":"Stephen Kelly"},"message":"Revert \"Misc. fixes for the Oracle / Sun compiler.\"\n\nThis reverts commit 97b65f8156734db2adc367b27c822a5fe332d740.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kitware/CMake/commits/be77679552dbda01d62b03a85de05ad7e7684862"},{"sha":"b162e9871e8fabacf6f565ad1ced05a6d234e25b","author":{"email":"fbd1bb53ae91c7d21c5feb88facb5fbef8543d8e@gmail.com","name":"Stephen Kelly"},"message":"Use insert instead of a loop in some cases.\n\nLimit this change to inserting into a vector from a vector.\n\nA follow up change can use insert for inserting into a set.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kitware/CMake/commits/b162e9871e8fabacf6f565ad1ced05a6d234e25b"},{"sha":"57969aebfc5bc3589972b497fc5deb30e292230f","author":{"email":"fbd1bb53ae91c7d21c5feb88facb5fbef8543d8e@gmail.com","name":"Stephen Kelly"},"message":"Use two-iterator std::set::insert where appropriate.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kitware/CMake/commits/57969aebfc5bc3589972b497fc5deb30e292230f"},{"sha":"6c02a443b92ba189288cbe9f01589e00cabfb994","author":{"email":"fbd1bb53ae91c7d21c5feb88facb5fbef8543d8e@gmail.com","name":"Stephen Kelly"},"message":"Help: Remove documented restriction on insert APIs.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kitware/CMake/commits/6c02a443b92ba189288cbe9f01589e00cabfb994"},{"sha":"59aa8d878e69fd694e44af3778e87615804ad53e","author":{"email":"fbd1bb53ae91c7d21c5feb88facb5fbef8543d8e@gmail.com","name":"Stephen Kelly"},"message":"Help: Remove documented restriction on find in conditions.\n\nThe necessary conversion is supported by all CMake host compilers.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kitware/CMake/commits/59aa8d878e69fd694e44af3778e87615804ad53e"},{"sha":"7403759846b9bd34bb425f5e90f6e367b80d1d58","author":{"email":"fbd1bb53ae91c7d21c5feb88facb5fbef8543d8e@gmail.com","name":"Stephen Kelly"},"message":"Help: Remove documented restriction on template use.","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kitware/CMake/commits/7403759846b9bd34bb425f5e90f6e367b80d1d58"},{"sha":"2e1ea034a804cd1ec61ba5b9817452d49b6d0830","author":{"email":"fbd1bb53ae91c7d21c5feb88facb5fbef8543d8e@gmail.com","name":"Stephen Kelly"},"message":"Merge topic 'sun-better-stdlib' into next\n\n74037598 Help: Remove documented restriction on template use.\n59aa8d87 Help: Remove documented restriction on find in conditions.\n6c02a443 Help: Remove documented restriction on insert APIs.\n57969aeb Use two-iterator std::set::insert where appropriate.\nb162e987 Use insert instead of a loop in some cases.\nbe776795 Revert \"Misc. fixes for the Oracle / Sun compiler.\"\n5e8b4a71 SolarisStudio: Use alternative standard library to build CMake.\n3b62cb72 CMake Nightly Date Stamp\nca3d08e6 CMake Nightly Date Stamp\n8e611401 CMake Nightly Date Stamp\n028cdfb3 CMake Nightly Date Stamp\n2b28e07c CMake Nightly Date Stamp\n05105d5c CMake Nightly Date Stamp","distinct":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kitware/CMake/commits/2e1ea034a804cd1ec61ba5b9817452d49b6d0830"},{"sha":"29b4f5420922a06cafeaf07c13b5d781790e8646","author":{"email":"fbd1bb53ae91c7d21c5feb88facb5fbef8543d8e@gmail.com","name":"Stephen Kelly"},"message":"RunCMake: Expect empty output by default.\n\nExpect tests to specify stderr content if it is present.\n\nFix the CMP0019 test, which has only been testing the WARN status\nuntil now.

I don't know if we should handle this case, and ones like it with `panic!()` instead of `loop` (or anything else that \"returns\" `!`).\r\n\r\nHowever, strictly speaking, it seems to me that changing the above to not warn will require changing\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn foo() {\r\n    while bar {}\r\n    foo()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto also not warn since it could be that the `while` is an infinite loop and doesn't ever hit the `foo`.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to think we let these cases warn since true edge cases like the first one seem rare, and if they do occur they seem like they would usually be typos in the function call. (I could imagine someone accidentally having code like `fn foo() { assert!(bar()); foo() /* meant to be boo() */ }` which won't warn if the `loop` case is \"fixed\".)\r\n\r\n(Part of the reason this is unresolved is wanting feedback, part of the reason is I couldn't devise a strategy that worked in all cases.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe name `unconditional_self_calls` is kinda clunky; and this reconstructs the CFG for each function that is linted which may or may not be very expensive, I don't know."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/comments/68477337","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/20373#issuecomment-68477337","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/20373","id":68477337,"user":{"login":"huonw","id":1203825,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1203825?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw","html_url":"https://github.com/huonw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huonw/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T01:05:28Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T01:05:28Z","body":"@luqmana, speaking prescriptively, \"recurs\" is actually *more* correct than recurses, e.g. http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/163446/does-a-recursive-procedure-recur ; I'm happy to change it if people prefer the recurse version."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T01:05:29Z","org":{"id":5430905,"login":"rust-lang","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/rust-lang","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5430905?"}}

We also already have apache running for horizon, so it could reduce number of services.    apache also has better logging options that haproxy which can only log to syslog.

One possibility is what is being added in #832, although as a callback API that might not fit your needs.  We could also add something like `doubled_module` to verifying doubles, although that has a couple of issues:\r\n\r\n* The doubled module may not be loaded, so it would have to return `nil` in that case which gives you no information.\r\n* As I mentioned above, I want to limit the number of built-in methods defined on doubles.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that we may want to go a more functional route where you would call `RSpec::Mocks.doubled_module_for(dbl)` instead.  (That would solve the latter problem).  For the former problem, we may want to make the API return a module reference (similar to what #832 is going) instead of the actual module.

What I really loved was something called \"Flexible Content Field\". \r\n\r\nhttp://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/flexible-content/\r\n\r\nThis was really awesome since it allowed me to make a set of grouped fields, then add them to this area that I wanted. I used this to make a pretty complex , yet easy to use selection of groups for the end user.\r\n\r\nIs this something you might consider to add to Admin Page Framework?

Let us consider an equivalent statement instead, which says that for n>= -1, is-n-type(A) is equivalent to\r\n\\Pi{a:A} is-contr(\\omega^{n+1}(A,a)).\r\n\r\nThe base case when n = -1 is Exercise 3.5, as in the current proof. For the inductive case it suffices to prove the logical equivalence between the two types, as they are both mere props. We have that is-(n+1)-type(A) is by definition\r\n\\Pi{x,y:A} is-n-type(x=y). By induction, this is equivalent to \\Pi{x,y:A} \\Pi{p:x=y} is-contr(\\omega^{n+1}(x=y,p)). On the other hand, \\Pi{x:A} is-contr(\\omega^{n+2}(A,x)) is definitionally equal to \\Pi{x:A} is-contr(\\omega^{n+1}(x=x,refl(x))).\r\nIt remains to show that the two types \\Pi{x,y:A} \\Pi{p:x=y} is-contr(\\omega^{n+1}(x=y,p)) and\r\n\\Pi{x:A} is-contr(\\omega^{n+1}(x=x,refl(x))) are logically equivalent. Going from left to right is obvious and from right to left is just path induction on p. So we are done. No?\r\n\r\nLemma 7.3.1 states that the n-truncation of A is an n-type. When reading the section on truncations for the first time, I was very confused by the motivation given via iterated loop spaces and maps of pointed types. Eventually I gave up and tried to understand it in a different way.\r\nFor example, we can first prove a lemma which says that for n >= -1, the statement that X is an n-type is equivalent to saying that, loosely speaking, any function from S^{n+1} to X is 'constant' (I am putting it in quotes since people like to argue about the terminology). Formally, for n >= -1, is-n-type(X) is equivalent to\r\n\\Pi{r: S^{n+1} \\to X} \\Sigma {h : X} \\Pi{z: S^{n+1}} r(z) = h. There is a simple proof by induction on n. I am not sure if this lemma might be useful in other places as a general characteristic of an n-type, but at the very least one direction of it is used in Theorem 7.3.2 without explicit justification.\r\nOf course, once we have the lemma the motivation for defining the truncation as we did, as well as the subsequent proof that the truncation is really an n-type, is trivial.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nKristina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoTT/book/issues/comments/68477349","html_url":"https://github.com/HoTT/book/issues/744#issuecomment-68477349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HoTT/book/issues/744","id":68477349,"user":{"login":"mikeshulman","id":646600,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/646600?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman","html_url":"https://github.com/mikeshulman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikeshulman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T01:06:04Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T01:06:04Z","body":"There's no a priori reason the proofs in the book are the simplest ones; they're just the ones that whoever was writing that chapter thought of at the time."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T01:06:04Z","org":{"id":692156,"login":"HoTT","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/HoTT","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692156?"}}

A (bfq_)queue is\nassociated to each task doing I/O on a device, and each time a scheduling\ndecision has to be made a queue is selected and served until it expires.\n\n    - Slices are given in the service domain: tasks are assigned budgets,\n      measured in number of sectors. Once got the disk, a task must\n      however consume its assigned budget within a configurable maximum time\n      (by default, the maximum possible value of the budgets is automatically\n      computed to comply with this timeout). This allows the desired latency\n      vs \"throughput boosting\" tradeoff to be set.\n\n    - Budgets are scheduled according to a variant of WF2Q+, implemented\n      using an augmented rb-tree to take eligibility into account while\n      preserving an O(log N) overall complexity.\n\n    - A low-latency tunable is provided; if enabled, both interactive and soft\n      real-time applications are guaranteed very low latency.\n\n    - Latency guarantees are preserved also in presence of NCQ.\n\n    - Also with flash-based devices, a high throughput is achieved while\n      still preserving latency guarantees.\n\n    - A useful feature borrowed from CFQ: static fallback queue for OOM.\n\n    - Differently from CFQ, BFQ uses a unified mechanism (Early Queue Merge,\n      EQM) to get a sequential read pattern, and hence a high throughput,\n      with any set of processes performing interleaved I/O. EQM also\n      preserves low latency. The code for detecting whether two queues have\n      to be merged is a slightly modified version of the CFQ code for\n      detecting whether two queues belong to cooperating processes and whether\n      the service of a queue should be preempted to boost the throughput.\n\n    - BFQ supports full hierarchical scheduling, exporting a cgroups\n      interface.  Each node has a full scheduler, so each group can\n      be assigned its own ioprio (mapped to a weight, see next point)\n      and an ioprio_class.\n\n    - If the cgroups interface is used, weights can be explictly assigned,\n      otherwise ioprio values are mapped to weights using the relation\n      weight = IOPRIO_BE_NR - ioprio.\n\n    - ioprio classes are served in strict priority order, i.e., lower\n      priority queues are not served as long as there are higher priority\n      queues.  Among queues in the same class the bandwidth is distributed\n      in proportion to the weight of each queue. A very thin extra bandwidth\n      is however guaranteed to the Idle class, to prevent it from starving.\n\nChange-Id: Iae219b7532e7c41a88601a77f86f8f20211c30da\nSigned-off-by: Paolo Valente <paolo.valente@unimore.it>\nSigned-off-by: Arianna Avanzini <avanzini.arianna@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: flar2 <asegaert@gmail.com>","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aow1980/kernel_lge_hammerhead/commits/cc6449f427439b647e8e521db660d15d1d20ed73"},{"sha":"831b6b7d7b89efd711eef2e14eb8b9f46b4916c5","author":{"email":"457cfb837588e6491cbd81701614a2c9f7081d84@gmail.com","name":"aow1980"},"message":"block: cgroups, kconfig, build bits for BFQ-v6-3.4\n\nUpdate Kconfig.iosched and do the related Makefile changes to include\nkernel configuration options for BFQ.

It seems quite stable, been using it for a few days (provided the configuration is correct, I suppose, didn't test what happens when ghc-modi is not correctly configured).\r\n\r\nI bound the type info call to the DocumentationProvider as well as to an action (alt - equals, like scala). I prefer the action, I think the documentation provider doesn't work so well. There are tests of the parsing of the output of ghc-modi, but not really of the documentationprovider, basically because of the abundance of static calls and the fact that I think they can only be mocked while testing, and statics can only be mocked through Powermock if I recall correctly, which would mean an extra test dependency and so on and so forth, so I left that to be your call.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a weird behaviour that getting the editor creates a stack trace of around 5 kilometers long, something that seems like a threading issue, but the function seems to work. I don't really know why the stack trace happens, all the more because it only happens when calling the type information through the documentation provider (same code path is used when the action is called, but no stack trace). Maybe you know more what could go wrong, it looks like something intellij-related.\r\n\r\nSo, consider this a \"request for comment\" more than a pull request ;-)\r\n\r\nKasper"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carymrobbins/intellij-haskforce/issues/comments/68477354","html_url":"https://github.com/carymrobbins/intellij-haskforce/pull/105#issuecomment-68477354","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carymrobbins/intellij-haskforce/issues/105","id":68477354,"user":{"login":"carymrobbins","id":3103764,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3103764?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins","html_url":"https://github.com/carymrobbins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carymrobbins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T01:06:08Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T01:06:08Z","body":"Nice work @KasperJanssens!

We also already have apache running for horizon, so it could reduce number of services.    apache also has better logging options that haproxy which can only log to syslog.

One of these (LastEvent) watches for events using the When.ModuleParameterIsChanging event and keeps several new parameters up to date (LastEvent, LastEventUpdateTime, LastOn, LastOnUpdateTime, LastOff, LastOffUpdateTime).  If the other scripts that rely on the LastEvent module run first, everything works correctly.  If the LastEvent module runs first, I run into problems with what exactly the values of these new parameters will be.\r\n\r\nI believe (but cannot confirm) that the execution order is based on the programID.  This was working acceptably until I had to replace my main code with a new instance during testing.  When this happened, the programID of the main code shifted from 1001 to 1016.  Since the LastEvent module reamained 1004, I believe this would cause it to execute prior to 1016.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 solutions I have come up with.\r\n1)  Provide some means to control the order that programs are executed.\r\n2)  Build these new parameter values (or equivalent) into the core HG code.\r\n\r\nExecution order could be something simple like a priority field where the user selects 1-5 which would then give a programID of the next available 1000, 2000, 3000, etc.  Or, something within the code itself specifying a priority.  Or, maybe allow the user to reorder the scripts in the interface and that order is the order of execution of the user codes.  I personally would think something that combines these would be best.\r\n\r\nI don't know how often this issue would occur, so I don't know how much effort is needed to correct it."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/genielabs/HomeGenie/issues/comments/68477374","html_url":"https://github.com/genielabs/HomeGenie/issues/80#issuecomment-68477374","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/genielabs/HomeGenie/issues/80","id":68477374,"user":{"login":"bkenobi","id":6903751,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6903751?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi","html_url":"https://github.com/bkenobi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkenobi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T01:07:15Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T01:07:15Z","body":"This might work, I'll have to try.

We also already have apache running for horizon, so it could reduce number of services.    apache also has better logging options that haproxy which can only log to syslog.

Someone who had already upgraded their database with the old migration scripts will still have their column named with a capital, and there's no easy way to get rid of it since sqlite does not support DROP COLUMN (issue #955). New databases created will work fine of course, and rerunning the migration4.py script will probably do it as well. Let us know if you want us to cancel this modification.\r\n\r\n2) We begun working on issue #485 by @dionyziz . We added the namecoin of the sender to the rest of the information in the 'start_handshake' and 'send' methods in CryptoPeerConnection and we also stored the namecoin the user entered with the rest of his info in CryptoTrasportLayer. Is this the right way to do it? Should we change anything else? We need a little feedback here @gubatron , @hoffmabc :) \r\n\r\n3) As it is now, TransportLayer does not have a 'namecoin' field. Should we add a namecoin field in there, and treat it in the same manner as nickname?\r\n\r\n4)Should we add the namecoin to the 'ok_msg' in transport.py (line 136)?\r\n\r\n5)We see that you sign the information *before* you encrypt it.

We also already have apache running for horizon, so it could reduce number of services.    apache also has better logging options that haproxy which can only log to syslog.
